 Come on, will ya
 Will ya go?
  Come on, go.<br>
 Hey.<br>
  You cheated on your current wife
 with seven different women.<br>
  I got digital proof
 of all of it.<br>
  And if you don't stop seeing Krista
 your wife will know everything.<br>
  Done.<br>
  And one more thing.<br> I'm gonna
 need something from you.<br>
  I donât just hack you, Krista.<br>
  I hack everyone.<br>
  So I gotta be honest,
 I was impressed by you.<br>
  I think I can land you
 a pretty lucrative gig.<br>
  Who are you?
  That'll come later.<br>
  Elliot,
 listen to me.<br>
  I will never leave you.<br> I will
 never leave you alone again.<br>
  Who are you talking to?
  Since last month,
  Evil Corp has moved
 its tapes to
  Five backup facilities.<br> And you
 have a plan to take them all down.<br>
  Why are you working with us?
  The hack, everything,
 maybe we shouldn't execute it.<br>
  Why?
  The minute our infected server gets
 back on the main network, we're set.<br>
  Scott will
 continue here.<br>
  But you, I'm afraid, cannot.<br>
  What the hell are you
 - Shh.<br>
  I don't know what your grand plan is, but
 I need to, and you're going to tell me.<br>
  Why did you do it?
  What did you hope to accomplish
 by doing all of this?
  I wanted to save the world.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  So good to see you.<br>
  You look great.<br>
  Can I get you a drink?
  Look, Michael, I don't
  Jesus.<br>
  I forgot.<br>
  That's not even your real name.<br>
  Uh
  It's, uh, Lenny.<br>
  Lenny.<br>
  Just tell me what's going on.<br>
  How advanced is it?
  I already emailed my friend
 at Sloan Kettering.<br>
  And if it's as serious
 as you say
  Krista, Krista
  Then she wants to see
  Look
  I'm not dying.<br>
  You're a sick motherfucker!
  Look, hold on.<br>
  Don't you ever call me again.<br>
 Even when you are dying.<br>
  One of your patients hacked me.<br>
  Some kid
 His name's Elliot Alderson.<br>
  I went to the police already.<br>
  Please, sit back down.<br>
  We need to talk about this.<br>
  Here.<br>
  The police had their cybercrime
 division look into it.<br>
  They've been trying to track him
 down for the past six weeks.<br>
  What is this?
  That proves it was him.<br>
 He took my dog to the vet.<br>
  See, she was micro-chipped And I gave her
 chip number to all the vets in the city.<br>
  This sick fucker not only
 hacked me and ruined my life,
  he stole my dog on top of it.<br>
  This guy's certifiable.<br>
  I mean, he's seeing you,
 so technically, he is.<br>
  What did he do to you exactly?
  He made me,
  you know,
  say all those things to you.<br>
  This kid should not be
 allowed to do what he did.<br>
  He hacked into my private life.<br>
  And then those Ashley Madison
 dumps happened.<br>
  My wife found out
 about everything anyway.<br>
  After the whole thing,
 she left me.<br>
  I can't even see my little girl.<br>
  The divorce is
 Is a nightmare
  I don't give a shit
 about your divorce.<br>
  If he's doing this to me, then he
 must be doing this to other people.<br>
  Think about it,
  if he knew enough about me
 to hack me,
  then that means
 he must've hacked you, too.<br>
  He did, didn't he?
  I can't talk about
 this with you.<br>
  Hey! You have to
 help me catch him.<br>
  The dog thing alone
 isn't enough.<br>
  My buddy says this
 Computer Abuse and Fraud Act
  is tough to prosecute.<br>
  You need a
 A lot of evidence.<br>
  All right, this kid is good,
 Krista.<br>
  He was routing through
 something called "proxies"
  or something out in Estonia.<br>
  He's untraceable.<br>
  Short of that whole country
 falling apart,
  we're never gonna get our
 hands on any real evidence.<br>
  And just what exactly
 do you think I can do?
  Maybe he said something?
  You know, in your sessions.<br>
  Oh.<br> Come on, don't give me
  that privileged
 information bullshit.<br>
  This guy's committing a crime,
 a serious one.<br>
  He deserves to go to jail.<br>
  If you know something,
  if he said anything,
 you have to tell me.<br>
  Look, I'm not the enemy here,
  he is.<br>
  We were a good thing.<br>
  Remember?
  I mean,
  don't you remember this place?
  We had some good times here.<br>
  Come on,
  don't stay mad at me.<br>
  I really loved you.<br>
  He never told me anything.<br>
  I can't help you.<br>
  The asshole stole my dog!
  The response
 to the Japanese and Chinese
  stock markets has provoked panic,
 setting off the downward trends
  of the European stock exchange.<br>
  But, what's even more
 worrisome is that the IMF
  has no leverage
 against these defaults.<br>
  Already, 17 governments are said
 to be in large-scale crisis,
  with some on
 the verge of collapse.<br>
  Amongst the countries are
 Lithuania, Croatia, Ukraine,
  Romania, the Czech Republic,
 and Estonia.<br>
  This faction
 has deemed the hack
  This is a world destruction,
 Your life ain't nothing
  The human race
 is becoming a disgrace
  Countries are fighting
 with chemical warfare
  Not giving a damn about
 the people who live there
  Yes, the world is
 headed for destruction
  Is it a nuclear war?
  What are you asking for?
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
  This is a world destruction
 Your life
  Who am I?
  Excuse me?
  I mean, where am I?
  You've been parked in the lot
 for the past two days.<br>
  That's as much as you paid me before
 the credit card systems went down.<br>
  I'm gonna need some cash, man.<br>
  This is Tyrell's.<br>
  Why were we in there?
  Aw, don't tell me you don't
 have any cash.<br>
  Huh, you're shit out of luck
 for a while, buddy.<br>
  I don't understand.<br>
  How long have you been asleep?
  Seriously
  What do you remember?
  Wait
 I don't even trust you.<br>
  Hey!
  Hey.<br> Where are you going?
 What about your car?
  Hey.<br> I'm gonna tow
 your car tonight!
  What took you so long?
  I just had to shower and change.<br>
  You're still new here
 I wouldn't push it.<br>
  Jesus Christ, finally you're here.<br>
 Where have you been?
  Yeah, man! I mean, not
 cool, not cool at all.<br>
  I thought we were gonna execute together.<br>
 I mean what is goin' on here?
  He's just saying that
 we had planned on something
  a little more ceremonial.<br>
  Ceremonial, man?
  We been wiping drives,
 wrinkling cables,
  pulling fiber chops
 in the adjunct vaults.<br>
  Everyone, lay off.<br>
 I'm sure he had his reasons.<br>
  'Sides, whatever,
 the point is, it worked.<br>
  Jesus.<br>
 What did I do?
  We need to clean up
 and get the hell outta here.<br>
  Were you there? Did you see it?
 What did I do?
  Elliot, what's going on?
  You disappear on me
 at the apartment and come here
  to execute without
 even telling me?
  Execute.<br>
 It executed?
  But how?
 I What happened to Tyrell?
  then you're gone
 for another three days.<br>
  Where have you been?
  Are you saying it went through?
  Like gangbusters.<br>
  Everyone's loving it.<br>
  People actually wanna
 join fsociety.<br>
  They're organizing protests
 all across the city.<br>
  Elliot!
  What's going on?
  Are you still seeing him?
  No, but I need to.<br>
  Dude, you canât just leave.<br>
  We're in wipe-down mode here
 and we need your help.<br>
  I told you we shouldn't
 have done this.<br>
  So, okay.<br>
  Your burn rate.<br> That's rent
 and utilities alone
  is 50,000 a month.<br>
  Your lease isn't up for
 another three months,
  so we have to eat those costs
 no matter what.<br>
  So, that leaves us with
 staffing, operations,
  outstanding loans,
 equipment rentals.<br>
  I'm just gonna call it, Gideon.<br>
  You have to shut down Allsafe.<br>
  Maybe I can just
  buy some time.<br>
  We could bounce back from this.<br>
  Gideon, your number one client is
 in the middle of a major crisis.<br>
  You can't escape
 the fallout from this.<br>
  As your part-time CFO and your friend,
 I have to be honest and tell you,
  this is beyond bleak.<br>
  When is it not?
  I'm sorry?
  Ever since I started
 this company
  it's felt like we've just been
  rearranging chairs
 on the goddamn Titanic.<br>
  When was the last time you and I have
 not had a depressing conversation?
  Gideon, I handle the money.<br> It's always
 gonna be a depressing conversation.<br>
  The best thing you can do for
 them is to let them know soon,
  so they can find other jobs.<br>
  And
  What?
  All their 401k's were
 tied up in the market
  which is expected to plummet
 once the bell rings.<br>
  Well, that's only
 rumors at this point.<br>
  What?
  It seems to be
 a little more than rumors.<br>
  Every bank
 is essentially affected.<br>
  I know I couldn't use any of my credit
 cards over the weekend.<br> Could you?
  Oh, I don't know.<br> There might
 be a silver lining to all this.<br>
  If what they're saying about these
 fsociety hackers is actually true
  You'll now have no debt.<br>
  Why did Tyrell
 let this happen?
  He was with me.<br>
 I told him the whole plan.<br>
  He was gonna stop it.<br>
  A simple program A worm
 that can make data unreadable.<br>
  Malware that took Darlene
 maybe two hours to code.<br>
  Is that really all it takes
 to kill the world?
  Shouldn't I be enjoying this?
  Why am I even
 looking for Tyrell?
  Isn't this what we wanted?
  So this is what a
 revolution looks like.<br>
  People in expensive clothing
 running around?
  Not how I pictured it.<br>
  I wonder what stage they're at.<br>
  Denial, muttering to themselves,
 "No, this can be fixed.<br>"
  Maybe bargaining, forcing their techs to
 work overtime to try to decrypt our data.<br>
  Or have they come to the realization
 yet that Darlene encrypted everything
  with 256-bit AES
  and it would take an incomprehensible
 amount of time to crack.<br>
  Security breaches
  That all of their data
 is actually gone,
  for good.<br>
  No.<br> I have to find him.<br>
  I have to know what happened.<br>
  Can I help you with something?
  Yes.<br> I'm looking for
 Tyrell Wellick.<br>
  He's not here.<br>
  He doesn't work here anymore.<br>
  Why are you here? What do
 you need to see him for?
  And yes,
 confirmation coming in.<br>
  Fsociety's claiming
 responsibility for the hack.<br>
  We are cutting live to
 the video right now.<br>
  Evil Corp.<br>
  We have delivered on
 our promise as expected.<br>
  The people of the world
  who have been enslaved by you
 have been freed.<br>
  Your financial data
 has been destroyed.<br>
  Any attempts to salvage it
 will be utterly futile.<br>
  Face it.<br>
  You have been owned!
  We, at fsociety,
  will smile as we watch you
  and your dark soul die.<br>
  That means any money you owe
 these pigs
  has been forgiven by us,
 your friends, at fsociety.<br>
  The market's opening bell
 this morning
  will be the final
 death knell of Evil Corp.<br>
  We hope, as a new society rises from the
 ashes, that you will forge a better world.<br>
  A world that values
 a free people.<br>
  A world where greed
 is not encouraged.<br>
  A world that belongs
 to us again!
  A world changed forever!
  And while you do that,
  remember to repeat these
 words.<br> "We are fsociety.<br>
  "We are finally free!
  "We are finally awake!"
  Authorities have been
 trying to locate the whereabouts
  of the mysterious masked man as well as
 other members of the fsociety collective.<br>
  The investigation
 is still underway.<br>
  The FBI cybercrime division is working
  Where's my bag?
  I need my bag.<br>
 It It has all of my papers.<br>
  I put all of your talking
 points on these index cards
  so that you wouldn't have
  God damn it! Will you please just
 give me my bag, for Christ's sake!
  I asked you to keep it close by!
  I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.<br>
 I was just trying to
  Never mind what you meant.<br>
 Just do as I say.<br>
  I'm sorry.<br>
  I didn't mean to snap at you.<br>
  It's been a long day and I
  I'm not used to all the young,
  new faces around here.<br>
  No problem.<br>
  Four minutes, people!
 It's your last look.<br> Let's go.<br>
  So, anyways, this should fry
 anything and everything to a crisp.<br>
  You're in luck,
 my boss is at the bank.<br>
  Seems like everybody's lining up
 this morning.<br> So you got some time.<br>
  Jesus, are we really
 doing this right now?
  Hey, I don't need no judgment.<br>
 Not like I wanna be here either.<br>
  Sorry, dude, I got no sympathy.<br>
  You don't want to put cute puppies out
 of their misery, you don't have to.<br>
  It's just sick.<br>
  That ain't on me.<br> I gotta pay the bills.<br>
 Only reason why I'm here.<br>
  You know, I've run all the scenarios
 of our little revolution here,
  but, uh, using a dead puppy
 oven was not on my list.<br>
  Teddy sniffing glue
 he was 12 years old
  Fell from the roof
 on East Two-Nine
  Cathy was 11
 when she pulled the plug
  On 26 reds and a bottle of wine
  Bobby got leukemia, 14 years old
  He looked like 65 when he died
  He was a friend of mine
  Those are people who died, died
  Those are people who died, died
  Those are people who died, died
  Those are people who died, died
  They were all my friends,
 they just died
  G-berg and Georgie let their
 gimmicks go rotten,
  So they died of hepatitis
 in upper Manhattan
  Sly in Vietnam took
 a bullet in the head
  Bobby OD'd on Drano on
 the night that he was wed
  They were two more
 friends of mine
  Two more friends that died
  Those are people who died, died
  They were all my friends,
 and they died
  Mary took a dry dive
 from a hotel room
  - Bobby hung himself from a cell
 in The Tombs,
  Judy jumped in front of
 a subway train
  Eddie got slit
 in the jugular vein
  And, Eddie, I miss you
 more than all the others
  Can I help you?
  Yeah.<br>
  I'm looking for Tyrell Wellick.<br>
  Is he here?
  No, he's not.<br>
  Do you know where he is?
  Who are you?
  Good question.<br>
  We work together.<br>
  He'll be home soon.<br>
  He just called me from the
 car 10 minutes ago,
  stuck in some traffic.<br>
  You're welcome to
 wait inside if you want.<br>
  Whoa!
 Ah!
  Shit.<br>
  Get up! Fsociety, bitch!
  What did you say your name was?
  Uh, I'm Ollie.<br>
  And what were you working on
 with my husband?
  You've gotta
 help get me out of this.<br>
  There's something about her.<br>
  I feel like she can hear us.<br>
  He wanted my advice.<br>
  You know, about the hack
 that's going on right now.<br>
  When was the last time
 you saw him?
  She's lying to me.<br>
 He isn't coming.<br>
  She's fishing for something.<br>
  I'm not sure.<br>
  It was last week, I think.<br>
  Really?
  You know, between you and me,
  I'm a little concerned
 for Tyrell.<br>
  Was he acting strange
 when you saw him?
  No.<br>
  That's funny.<br>
  Because he was acting
 very strange last I saw him.<br>
  Three days ago.<br>
  Didn't she say
 he just called?
  And then he just vanished.<br>
  Excuse me?
  I don't understand
 what you're saying.<br>
  Are you okay?
  Yeah.<br>
  I think it's just the stress
  from the past few days
 getting to me.<br>
  Anyway, I shouldn't take up
 any more of your time.<br>
  Thank you,
  Ollie.<br>
  And, Sarah, we've had meetings all
 weekend handling the situation.<br>
  I'm being told by our network
 storage team that they are in fact
  getting to the bottom of this.<br>
  Mr.<br> Plouffe, have
 you seen the latest stock price?
  It's hitting an all-time low of
 $18 and it's still dropping.<br>
  How are people reacting
 to this on the inside?
  Almost $400 billion
 of wealth was lost today.<br>
  That's pretty astounding.<br>
 Are you concerned?
  That's an interesting question.<br>
  Right now, we are focused on tackling
 the technical issues at hand.<br>
  We have loyal customers who are
 suffering and our number one priority
  is to address their needs.<br>
  We had one of our
 experts in here earlier today.<br>
  They're saying that if, in fact,
 fsociety's claims are true,
  your data is inaccessible and could
 prove nearly impossible to recover.<br>
  And given that there does seem
 to be some legitimacy to this
  The White House
 is with us on this.<br>
  They're gonna protect
 everyone's money.<br>
  The bottom line is, the public
 does not need to worry about this.<br>
  Mr.<br> Plouffe,
 this was a massive attack.<br>
  All of your servers including
 your data center in China,
  as well as your offline
 backups, have been destroyed.<br>
  I'm not really sure you can
 ask the public not to worry.<br>
  You want me to be honest?
  - Of course.<br>
 - You're right.<br>
  Absolutely right.<br>
 The public should be worried.<br>
  I mean
  Personally, my life is over.<br>
  My pension, savings, everything
  has been in this company since I
 started here.<br> And that's all gone now.<br>
  The truth is,
  I've been with the engineering
 team all weekend.<br>
  No one knows how to fix it.<br>
  In fact, about the only thing we
 do know for certain is that
  This will be impossible to fix.<br>
  Go take care of this.<br>
  Calm down, everyone.<br>
  Good.<br> Thank you.<br>
 Thanks.<br>
  I heard you were leaving
 for the day.<br>
  Um, Mr.<br> Price
  Did you need me to stay?
  No.<br> No, no.<br> No.<br>
 Sit.<br> Sit.<br>
  I I know I'm the CEO of
 the company,
  but what you went through,
  it was traumatic.<br>
  I just felt I needed
 to make myself available.<br>
  You are absolutely free to
 To go home and, and recover.<br>
  Of course.<br>
  All right?
  Uh
  You're Terry's reference, right?
  I rarely see him impressed with
 anyone, but you You, well
  We're glad you're on the team.<br>
  And I look forward to you
 impressing me as well.<br>
  Yeah, I'm I'm holding a press
 conference this afternoon.<br>
  Since you're new to the PR department, I
 I think you should attend.<br>
  You might pick up some
 invaluable lessons.<br>
  Um
  No.<br>
  No, I'm not sure that I can.<br>
  Well
  The invitation is open
  if you should change your mind.<br>
  Um
  You need some new shoes.<br>
  Those won't do anymore.<br>
  Tyrell Wellick's gone, I wake up in
 his SUV, and the world's about to fall apart.<br>
  I know, I know this looks bad, but
 I'm sure there's an explanation.<br>
  Don't think that!
  We'll find him, We'll find him.<br>
  He's gotta be somewhere.<br>
  My dad, Mr.<br> Robot,
 whatever the hell he is,
  if he's not gonna show up,
 maybe he got sloppy.<br>
  Left behind a clue.<br>
  All right.<br> Come out!
  Come out now!
  Come on!
  I need to know what happened!
  Come on out!
  I'm here!
  I'm waiting for you!
  Come on, man.<br>
  Come out!
  Okay.<br> We have to go
 analog for this.<br>
  We need to get
 these fliers out now
  since we can't be sure anyone's
 Internet access will work.<br>
  Uh
  What?
  I'm thinking ahead.<br>
  First banking, then infrastructure.<br>
 We've been through this.<br>
  Now, take these fliers,
 pass them out.<br>
  It's the last step
 and then we're clear.<br>
  You guys are acting like we're
 walking towards doomsday here.<br>
  Well, yeah, it does say here it's
 an "end of the world party.<br>"
  Figure of speech.<br>
  You wonder why we're
 not in high spirits?
  Maybe it's because our fearless
 leader goes and shoots up the world
  and then disappears, yet again,
  while we're here
 cleaning up after him.<br>
  He knows the password.<br>
  Which means I know the password.<br>
  What's he trying to say?
  I'm on the hook for everything?
  He won't come out to play
 if I ask,
  so maybe I gotta force his hand.<br>
  I need to use the landline.<br>
  I need to
 get myself arrested.<br>
  911,
 what's your emergency?
  I have a confession
 to make.<br>
  All right, you got me.<br>
  I'm afraid to ask.<br>
  Wait a minute,
 you said you work
  Was this from the guy
  The one they're talking
 about on the news?
  Um
  Yes.<br>
  You mean to tell me
 you witness this thing
  And you're here
 to buy new shoes?
  Wow.<br>
  That's pretty It's
  It's just, pretty cold.<br>
  How can you work there?
  That guy said it himself,
 they're just liars.<br>
  I know.<br>
  They are.<br>
  But,
  I'm not sure that he knew
 what he was saying.<br>
  Oh, you sound just like them.<br>
  Have some moral fiber
 and leave their asses.<br>
  Their practices are well documented
 and it's all despicable.<br>
  Listen, this isn't my business,
 but don't drink their Kool-Aid.<br>
  Look, I just needed a job.<br>
  What kind of an excuse is that?
  You don't understand.<br>
  You should hear yourself.<br>
  I don't know who you think you're talking
 to, but I'll try the Pradas next.<br>
  Calm down.<br>
  I'll get you a caramel latte.<br>
 It's on me.<br>
  Where is he?
  You know how this looks,
 right? Very weird.<br>
  I don't give a shit.<br>
  Where's Tyrell?
  We made a deal
 that helped us both.<br>
  Tell me where he is!
  You're starting to attract
 some attention.<br>
  I recommend you get one of
 those Bluetooth headsets.<br>
  That way people will just think
 you're the local douche.<br>
  Tyrell disappeared, no
 one knows where he is.<br>
  But you know.<br>
  So do you.<br>
  You forget, kiddo,
  I am you.<br>
  No, you're not.<br>
  Is that a fact?
  Hey, man.<br>
  I gotta tell you, I had sex
 with your mom this morning,
  and it was fantastic.<br>
  Don't have time
 for you, little man.<br>
  Oh, it was
 real nice.<br> Smell.<br>
  You're losing it, kiddo.<br>
  I'm only supposed to be
 your prophet.<br>
  You're supposed to be my God.<br>
  Come on.<br>
  The dramatic repercussions
 of the recent financial meltdown
  are not relegated
 to developing nations.<br>
  The United States has also witnessed
 a disruption of order and peace.<br>
  While businesses determine how or whether
 they can function through the uncertainty,
  individuals have taken
 to the streets
  Oh.<br>
  Very nice.<br>
  I'm glad you reconsidered.<br>
  What What is it?
  Come on
  You have questions
  I'm a person with a lot of answers.<br>
 Especially right now.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  It's just that
  Well, I can't help but wonder,
  why do you seem so confident?
  Everyone else is worried,
 but you
  You're sure that you're gonna
 get through this.<br>
  - Why?
 - Hmm.<br>
  People did this, right?
  Aliens didn't invade
 our planet.<br>
  Zeus didn't come out of
 the heavens to destroy us.<br>
  And zombies haven't risen
 from the dead.<br>
  No.<br>
  Whoever's behind this,
  they're just people,
  like you and me.<br>
  Except of course, I have
 the full weight of
  the biggest conglomerate
 in the world behind me.<br>
  You'll come to realize
 that when you have that,
  matters like this,
 they tend to crack
  under that weight.<br>
  Can I ask another question?
  All right.<br> Go.<br>
  Why me?
  Why am I really here?
  I know you know who I am.<br>
  Why are you letting me be here?
  Why are you even
 talking to me right now?
  None of this makes any sense.<br>
  Well, be that as it may, I
  I find you refreshing.<br>
  You're young, bold.<br>
  Exactly what we need right now.<br>
  - Come on.<br>
 - What?
  There has to be more to it than that.<br>
  Angela,
  just a word of advice.<br>
  Don't talk your way
 out of a compliment.<br>
  Shall we?
  Oh
  You're still thinking
 about this morning.<br>
  I don't think I'll ever
 get that image out of my head.<br>
  Between you and me,
 I was glad he killed himself.<br>
  He was not a very good person.<br>
  He had a gambling problem.<br> He drank
 too much.<br> Most notably, he was weak.<br>
  His instincts left
 a lot to be desired.<br>
  Oh, I despise people like that.<br>
  In fact, I felt
  the world was
 a little better off
  knowing he wasn't in it anymore.<br>
  Uh, I believe even his family will
 benefit from this, in the long run.<br>
  Before we even begin,
  let's have a moment of silence
 for our dear, brave friend
  James Plouffe.<br>
  Hey, dirty,
 Baby I got your money
  Hey, dirty,
 Baby I got your money
  Don't you worry, Say, hey
  Well, this place is
 a petri dish now.<br>
  Yup, I'd say we got enough
 fingerprints everywhere.<br>
  So that's it then,
 right?
  "That's it?"
  That's it?
  How about, "That's amazing"?
  How about we party and
  thank ourselves for all
 the hard work we did?
  Yeah, I don't think Trenton
 was talking about tonight.<br>
  Well, what then?
  Well, you know, I I think
 she's saying, after tonight.<br>
  Right? Then what?
 I mean, what do we all do now?
  Guys! This isn't about
 what we'll do tomorrow.<br>
  This is about what we did.<br>
  I mean, look at
 all these people.<br>
  They're free because of us.<br>
  Because of what we did
 in this room.<br>
  We are finally awake!
  We are finally alive.<br>
  We are free.<br> We are free.<br>
 We are free.<br> We are free.<br> We are free.<br>
  I know you killed him.<br>
  I know you did it.<br>
  I know you did it.<br> Just tell
 me what happened to Tyrell.<br>
  Shut up!
  I have played nice
 for far too long.<br>
  I'm so sick of your whining.<br>
  It's not gonna change
 anything, anyway.<br>
  Please,
 you have to do something.<br>
  You have to help me, say
 something, make him tell me.<br>
  Stop talking
 to them.<br>
  They can't help us.<br>
  We have to do this together.<br>
 Just us.<br>
  He's right,
 you know.<br>
  You're hurting
 the whole family, Elliot.<br>
  No, no.<br>
  This isn't my family.<br>
 None of them are real.<br>
  Neither is whoever
 you're talking to.<br>
  You're not real.<br>
  You're not real.<br>
  And what?
 You are?
  Is any of it real?
  I mean, look at this!
  Look at it!
  A world built on fantasy.<br>
  Synthetic emotions in
 the form of pills.<br>
  Psychological warfare in
 the form of advertising.<br>
  Mind-altering chemicals in
 the form of food.<br>
  Brain-washing seminars in
 the form of media.<br>
  Controlled isolated bubbles in
 the form of social networks.<br>
  Real?
  You wanna talk about reality?
  We haven't lived in anything remotely close
 to it since the turn of the century.<br>
  We turned it off,
 took out the batteries,
  snacked on a bag
 of GMOs while we
  tossed the remnants in the ever-expanding
 dumpster of the human condition.<br>
  We live in branded houses,
  trademarked by corporations
 built on
  bipolar numbers jumping up and
 down on digital displays,
  hypnotizing us into the biggest
 slumber mankind has ever seen.<br>
  You have to dig pretty deep, kiddo,
 before you can find anything real.<br>
  We live in
 a kingdom of bullshit!
  A kingdom you've
 lived in for far too long.<br>
  So, don't tell me
 about not being real!
  I'm no less real than the fucking
 beef patty in your Big Mac.<br>
  As far as you're concerned,
 Elliot, I am very real.<br>
  We are all together now,
 whether you like it or not.<br>
  Fsociety! Fsociety!
 Fsociety! Fsociety!
  No.<br>
  No!
  No!
  I want to be alone.<br>
  I need to be alone.<br>
  No, you
 don't want that, remember?
  Remember how you felt
 when you were alone?
  You were in pain.<br> You were
 miserable-That's why we're here.<br>
  On those lonely nights when you
 sat and cried in your apartment,
  you begged us to help you.<br> You asked
 us to come.<br> You needed us to come.<br>
  No!
  I want you to leave!
  Leave!
  We're deep down
 inside you, Elliot.<br>
  You can't leave us.<br>
 And we can't leave you.<br>
  Even.<br>
  It's true, son.<br>
  I don't know what
 I'm supposed to do.<br>
  I'll tell you exactly
 what you're gonna do.<br>
  You're gonna start
 listening to us.<br>
  The world is a better place
 because of what we did, Elliot.<br>
  And you're gonna realize
 that one way or another.<br>
  Now, here's what
 I need you to do now.<br>
  You're going to
 walk to the subway.<br>
  You're going to
 get on your train.<br>
  You're going to get
 off at your stop.<br>
  You're going to go home.<br>
  You're gonna sit
 at your computer,
  watch and enjoy the beautiful carnage
 that we've all created together.<br>
  As a new
 society rises from the ashes.<br>
  But you will forge
 a better world
  Sound and color with me
 in my mind
  Sound and color
 Try to keep myself awake
  Sound and color
 This life ain't like a book
  Sound and color
 Try to keep myself awake
  Sound and color
 This life ain't like a book
  Sound and color
 Try to keep myself awake
  Sound and color
 This life ain't like a book
  Sound and color
 I wanna touch a human being
  Sound and color
 I want to go back to sleep
  Sound and color Ain't
 life just awfully strange
  Sound and color You wish
 you never gave it all away
  Sound and color The more the
 feeling seem to end the same
  Sound and color Life is
  Sound and color
  Sound and color
  Sound and color
  Sound and color
  Sound and color
  Go ahead.<br>
 What's on your mind?
  I know you're not without
 your troubles,
  but we still haven't discussed
 the coltan mines.<br>
  Are you really bringing
 that up at a time like this?
  You asked,
 I answered succinctly.<br>
  Well, perhaps I was too hasty.<br>
  I'd like, for the moment,
 to take in the music.<br>
  Besides, plenty of other items on our
 agenda The fucking Congo can wait.<br>
  Well, your troubles
 are weighing heavily on you.<br>
  I'm not entirely sure why.<br>
  I was told that you know
 the person responsible.<br>
  Yes, yes, of course we do.<br>
  And we will handle
 that person as we usually do.<br>
  You seem a little
 preoccupied yourself.<br>
  I don't believe
 in preoccupation.<br>
  It's more of an observation.<br>
  Which is?
  The infamous emperor Nero
 played an instrument
  very similar to
 the one she's playing.<br>
  The lyre.<br>
  Legend has it that he played
 it merrily as he watched
  As he watched?
  As he watched Rome burn.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
