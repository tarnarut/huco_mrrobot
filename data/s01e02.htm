                    			What I'm about
 to tell you is top secret.<br>
  Oh, hi.<br> Tyrell Wellick.<br>
  You wanna do these together then?
  - Pure molly.<br>
 - No, Shayla.<br>
  I need you to come to Allsafe.<br>
  Shit, they're in the network.<br>
  This is it.<br> fsociety.<br>
  They're telling me to leave it here.<br>
  Who are you?
  I think
 you should come with me.<br>
  Yeah, that's Darlene.<br>
  You are gonna modify the DAT file.<br>
  Put Colby's IP in there.<br>
  You do that, you'll have set in motion
  the largest revolution
 the world will ever see.<br>
    Sources have confirmed
  the hacks were in part
 tied to Colby's terminal.<br>
  Sir, step inside the car.<br>
  Bonsoir, Elliot.<br>
  "Give a man a
 gun and he can rob a bank,
  but give a man a bank,
 and he can rob the world.<br>"
  It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.<br>
  A little reductive, but still
  I like it,
  for the same reason most people hate it,
  because to me it means that power belongs
  to the people that take it.<br>
  Nothing to do with their
 hard work, strong ambitions,
  or rightful qualifications, no.<br>
  The actual will to take is often
 the only thing that's necessary.<br>
  I'm sorry to bring you in like this.<br>
  Technically what we're doing
 might be considered illegal,
  which is why I'm surrounded
  by eleven of our most annoying lawyers.<br>
  Elliot Alderson
  I want to offer you
  a position here at Evil Corp.<br>
  I want you to head our
 cybersecurity division.<br>
  Except I can't officially
 offer you anything
  since we have this non-compete
 with your employer, Allsafe.<br>
  But if you do this of your own accord
  when you do this
  you'll be a multi-millionaire
 within the next five years.<br>
  What do you say?
  Can I
  Can I think about it?
  Gentlemen, I need the room.<br>
  Yes, thank you.<br> Yes, yes.<br>
  You know,
  Evil Corp has just named me interim CTO.<br>
  It won't be long until it's official.<br>
  I will be the youngest executive
 this company has ever seen.<br>
  I should track down these hackers out there
  just to thank them.<br>
  In a way, it's kind of, um
  What's the word in English?
  Serendipitous? Right?
  You know, by the end of the quarter,
  we're going to revamp our entire network
  and consolidate our security protocols.<br>
  We're going to handle
 everything internally,
  which means all of our
 vendors, including Allsafe,
  will be cut loose.<br>
  And it's no secret that once
 Allsafe loses us as a client,
  they'll be fini.<br>
  And when that happens,
  I want you to be where you belong:
  here with me.<br>
  This is an important choice
 you're making, Elliot.<br>
  I just wanted you to know all the facts
  before you made your final decision.<br>
  I think I'm happy where I am.<br>
  Well, I thought I'd ask.<br>
  Call this number if you need to
 get in touch with Mr.<br> Wellick.<br>
  You can call me Mr.<br> X.<br>
  Come on, you've never seen JFK?
  Oliver Stone movie?
  Sir, I gotta be honest.<br>
 That's embarrassing.<br>
  Do yourself a favor and watch it.<br>
  And pay, for Christ's sake.<br>
  Anyway, you can call me
 Mr.<br> Sutherland for now.<br>
  Don't hesitate to reach
 me when you're ready.<br>
  We're always close by.<br>
  I'm gonna set a date right now
  - No, we're not.<br>
 - For later.<br>
  I gotta go, thank you very much.<br>
  - You gonna have me up?
 - No.<br>
  - Gonna have me up?
 - No, stop.<br>
  - I'm coming up.<br>
 - No, you're not coming up.<br>
  Another time.<br> Okay, I gotta go.<br>
  Come on.<br>
  - Everything all right?
 - Yeah, he's just a creeper.<br>
  I hate it when your
 employers can't take a hint.<br>
  Hey, is your radiator messed up?
  Because it's like 3,000
 degrees in my apartment.<br>
  Hey, are you okay? You seem off.<br>
  While we're here, you mind if I reup?
  A little early to reup, don't you think?
  I'm deviating from the schedule a little.<br>
  Whoa, never thought I'd see
 the day, Mr.<br> Stricty Pants,
  but okie dokie.<br>
  Oh, yeah.<br> Shit, I'm out of the other ones.<br>
  No, just the morphine.<br> It's good.<br>
  Uh, no, you made me promise
 never to give you these
  unless I had your Subs.<br>
  - Shayla.<br>
 - No, Elliot.<br>
  Promises matter, okay?
  I take this shit to heart.<br>
  Oh, my God.<br>
  Fine, but you have to
 promise me you won't do a lot
  until I get your withdrawal meds, okay?
  I'll go see Fernando later or something.<br>
  No, you have to say it.<br>
  I promise.<br>
  Hey, man.<br>
  What, you think I forgot about you?
  Trust me, I need you now more than ever.<br>
  We gotta get to work.<br>
  Hacking Tyrell Wellick,
 you'd think it'd be tricky,
  but it wasn't Evil Corp's
 corporate mail servers,
  they haven't patched
 anything since Shellshock.<br>
  He doesn't even use two-step verification.<br>
  His password was just
 his wife's maiden name
  and Sweden's independence date, 6-6.<br>
  One six away from the obvious, but still,
  this is bad noob practice.<br>
  These emails
  His life it's nice, happy, perfect.<br>
  This doesn't make sense.<br>
  Did he know I was going to hack him?
  Did he let me?
  I'm gonna need to wipe everything.<br>
  I know, I
 know, taking more than I should.<br>
  I'm breaking my rule, but
 come on, it's an off week.<br>
  Come on.<br>
  Yo.<br> My man, you gotta
  You gotta deuce it out
 over here, all right?
  Yo, you gotta do your
 business up in here, all right?
  Hey
  You got this.<br> You got this.<br>
  Terry Colby, the chief
 technology officer of
  Terry Colby's
 arrest is on everyone's mind.<br>
  Screen.<br> Might as well be
 the same thing nowadays.<br>
  How do I go back to work after this?
  How can I focus on anything?
  And when's Mr.<br> Robot
 going to contact me again?
  What's he waiting for?
  Did I just destroy a
 man's life for no reason?
  I'm gonna talk to HR
 about a salary bump for you.<br>
  - Oh, please.<br>
 - No, no.<br>
  Take the raise.<br>
  It's not gonna be much, but
 it's the best I can do right now.<br>
  Elliot
  You saved the company.<br>
  Now
  Why didn't you tell me about the DAT file?
  You could've come in here at
 any time before the meeting
  to say you found something, but you didn't.<br>
  I gotta be honest.<br> I
 found that kind of curious.<br>
  Yeah, I didn't know what I had.<br>
  Could've easily been a junk file.<br>
  C'mon
  You're never sure about anything
  unless there's something to be sure about.<br>
  Maybe you don't know me that well.<br>
  Regardless,
  I still need you to stay
 on it, now more than ever.<br>
  I mean, who knows what
  these fsociety hackers
 are going to do next.<br>
  What did he just say?
  - What did you just say?
 - The ones working with Colby.<br>
  Who knows how deep these
 data dumps are going to get,
  and Evil Corp is
  What're you talking about?
  There's a twist.<br>
  You're usually the one a step ahead of me.<br>
  They hit the mother lode during the breach.<br>
  Potentially terabytes
 worth of emails and files.<br>
  They're threatening to dump everything
  unless the FBI frees Colby.<br>
  They released the video this morning.<br>
  Hello, Evil Corp.<br> We are fsociety.<br>
  Over the years, we have been watching you.<br>
  Your financial abuse of the poor;
  your corruption of governments;
  your cover-ups of the murder
 of innocent, ordinary citizens,
  all for the sake of a profit.<br>
  This is why we at fsociety
 have decided you must die.<br>
  We are malicious and
 hostile.<br> We do not compromise.<br>
  We are relentless.<br>
  We will not stop until every tentacle
  of your evil monstrosity
 is sliced off at the nerve.<br>
  But we are also not without mercy.<br>
  Our latest hack was our last warning.<br>
  Meet our demands, and we will
 consider not destroying you.<br>
  First, release our leader Terry Colby
  from your illegitimate prison immediately.<br>
  Second, release all the people of the world
  from your even more
 illegitimate prisons of debt.<br>
  Third, dissolve your corporation
  and donate all your assets
 to charities around the world.<br>
  This proposal is non-negotiable.<br>
  The people are realizing they
 don't have freedom of choice
  so long as you exist.<br>
  The people are waking up,
  no longer accepting your economic slavery.<br>
  Meet these demands, or we will kill you.<br>
  Consider yourself warned.<br>
  Play it again.<br>
  Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.<br>
  Yo, please buy my CD.<br>
 Only cost you 20 likes.<br>
  Yo, it'll give you the
 feels, y'all, I swear.<br>
  The CD's free.<br> All's I ask is you Tweet.<br>
  Help my social media outreach.<br>
  You know, be like, "I
 want to set up this meeting.<br>
  It's like a very, like a " Oh, Elliot!
  Hey, congrats, man.<br>
  Allsafe is all over the
 internet today because of you.<br>
  Dude, we should celebrate.<br>
 We have this Groupon
  for four at Morton's on Thursday.<br>
  This other couple we were
 going with totally bailed.<br>
  Why don't you come with?
  Their steaks are badass.<br> It's $29.<br>95
  I'm not sure that
 Elliot would like that.<br>
  Yeah, okay.<br>
  Yeah? Okay.<br> Awesome, man.<br>
  And, hey, why don't we
 make it a double date?
  I heard that you had a girlfriend.<br>
  Ollie, you weren't
 supposed to say anything.<br>
  Babe, it's cool.<br>
 Elliot's okay with it.<br>
  Yeah, okay, sure.<br> I have to go.<br>
  Um, my neighbor's complaining
 about the dog barking again.<br>
  - Since when does he have a dog?
 - Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.<br>
  You look like a beautiful couple.<br>
  Yo, my album just dropped,
  You like rap, hip-hop?
  Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.<br>
  Yo, your girl will like
 this, my man, I swear.<br>
  Come on, bro, you've
 been outside our building
  for two weeks now.<br>
  All right, you know, I'll take it,
  if you leave us alone.<br>
  Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.<br>
  And I'll tweet, but only
 if I like it, all right?
  I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.<br>
  - No doubt, no doubt.<br>
 - Some tastemakers in there so
  I feel you, I feel you.<br>
  - Yeah.<br>
 - All right.<br>
  Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.<br>
  - You guys have a good day.<br>
 - Yeah, you too.<br>
  Thank you so much.<br> Check track two out.<br>
  - Track two.<br>
 - All right, man.<br>
  This was never part of the plan.<br>
  Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?
  None of this makes sense.<br>
  Need to cut off all ties with fsociety.<br>
  Need to disconnect.<br>
  We need to call in sick
 and lie low for a
  Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!
  Don't stare at me!
  Why the hell are you in my shower?
  Well, I was waiting for you.<br>
  You were supposed to come last night.<br>
  - Did you forget?
 - Come? Where?
  It's fine, everyone's coming later.<br>
  I'm stealing your clothes.<br>
  My dress has cum stains on it.<br>
  Jesus, I am just messing with you.<br>
  My stuff is just in the wash.<br>
  I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.<br>
  Oh, by the way,
  your dog shat on your bed.<br>
  You gotta walk that thing.<br>
  Hey, please take Flipper for a while.<br>
  She probably needs a walk or something.<br>
  She keeps shitting everywhere.<br>
  Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.<br>
  She's a friggin' dog.<br>
  Yo, I want to stop and get
 some froyo before we go.<br>
  Uh, I'll be back later.<br>
  - I owe you.<br>
 - Yeah, big time.<br>
  How do you know where I live?
  Why wouldn't I know where you live?
  I don't know.<br> I don't know where you live.<br>
  Well,
  I don't live anywhere at the present.<br>
  The douche I was dating
 proposed to me, can you believe?
  I mean, what an asshole.<br>
  Anyways, we got into
 this huge fight, and
  What the hell am I doing?
  This chick is out of
 her mind batshit crazy.<br>
  I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.<br>
  He'll understand, right?
  He'll know what to do.<br>
  It's whatevs.<br> He'll take me back.<br>
  He's just gotta get over this whole
  "love is forever" bullshit.<br>
  I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,
  and then he'll come to his senses.<br>
  Stand clear of the closing door.<br>
  You know, it's our thing.<br>
  Quick!
  Can she see them, too?
  What?
  I like to stay on my toes.<br>
  Speaking of, that's, like, one
 of the most annoying things
  But what if Tyrell finds
 out? What will he do?
  Shit, there's basically
 no scenario in which
  I'm not getting killed or going to jail.<br>
  Because I wanted a turtle,
 and he was like, "No"
  I might need to crash with
 you for a couple of nights.<br>
  That's cool, right?
  Seriously?
  Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.<br>
  Don't love dogs anyway.<br>
  Especially ones that shit in your bed.<br>
  I mean, how do you live
 like that, honestly?
  How do you go to sleep when
 you know that there's
  For all we know,
  I could be walking into a trap right now.<br>
  We could be dead the second
 I walk through that door.<br>
  Come on, kid.<br> We got big things in store.<br>
  Big things.<br>
  Man of the hour.<br> Take a curtsy.<br>
  Goddamn ducks.<br>
  Hey, hey, man!
  What's oh.<br> Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.<br>
  Um, okay.<br>
  Anyway, just, awesome work, man.<br>
  Really awesome.<br>
  Right on, man.<br> Right on.<br>
  - Real cool.<br>
 - Great.<br>
  So now that we're all done
 going down on each other,
  can we please hear the plan?
  Where are we at with Steel Mountain?
  If I'm not mistaken,
  these lines aren't 100% safe yet,
  and we still haven't made
 the Colby project disappear.<br>
  Seriously?
  It's been weeks.<br> Any links or traces
  would have been owned by now.<br>
  The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.<br>
  - Thank you.<br>
 - I mean, um
  if it makes you feel better,
 Romero and I can check
  Great! Make me feel great.<br>
  I'm gonna hang back over
 here, collect my thoughts.<br>
  Ohh!
  What's her deal?
  Ah, she's a complicated woman.<br>
  Most malware coders are.<br> Am I right?
  She showed up at my apartment.<br>
  Why does she know where I live?
  Let's not focus on her.<br> That'll be like
  entering a bad K-hole
 you'll never wake up from.<br>
  Instead, I need you to focus on
 the next phase of our project.<br>
  Comet, the natural gas
 plant up around Albany?
  We're gonna blow it up.<br>
  Why would you blow
  Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.<br>
  Which, as you know,
  is the off-site and data storage facility
  for every corporation in the S&P,
  including everyone's favorite
  - Evil Corp.<br>
 - Bingo!
  You're gonna destroy their tape backups.<br>
  They're gonna be looking
 out for something like that.<br>
  They've been on high
 alert ever since the hack.<br>
  From what I heard, they've
 caught their hacker.<br>
  - Haven't they?
 - No, they haven't.<br>
  - Tyrell Wellick knows.<br>
 - What they want him to know!
  He's a corporate robot
 just like the rest of them.<br>
  Besides, the entire
 company is gonna be reeling
  from all the data dumps
 we've got in store for them
  and man, do we have some goodies.<br>
  Some good old-fashioned executive racism,
  sexism, fascism.<br>
  Trust me, we are gonna
 "ism" so much all over them
  they won't be able to see straight.<br>
  And asking for Colby's
 release as ransom was genius.<br>
  That'll only make his spotlight bigger,
  keeping it off us.<br>
  That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.<br>
  She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.<br>
  She's got some Allah Akbar in her.<br>
  And while all that's going on,
  you will use your
 Allsafe security clearance
  to hack the Comet PLC,
 increase the pressure,
  causing a gas pipeline explosion
  making Steel Mountain go kablooey
  along with Evil Corp's soul.<br>
  They know about all this?
  You're the first.<br>
  Workers?
  Anyone living around the plant
  They all die?
  We'll give them a head start.<br>
  Sound some alarms.<br> They'll be fine.<br>
  You're blowing up a gas pipeline.<br>
  The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,
  not because of those who do evil,
  but because of those who
 look on and do nothing.<br>
  This is war.<br>
  People will die.<br> C'est la mort.<br>
  And once we blow up the pipeline,
  Darlene's worm will kick into high gear
  at the U.<br>S.<br> data center
  which you helped to us
 install, thank you very much.<br>
  The redundant backups at their
 eastern data center in China
  the Dark Army is covering us on that.<br>
  Dark Army? Why, man?
  They got no code.<br> They hack for anyone:
  terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia
  Which means they hate U.<br>S.<br> capitalism
  just as much as anyone.<br>
  Last but not least.<br>
  Steel Mountain.<br>
  The hacker's dilemma.<br> What to do
  when a bunch of data you want to destroy
  is completely off the grid?
  I'm not killing anyone.<br>
  Tell me one thing, Elliot.<br>
  Are you a one or a zero?
  That's the question you
 have to ask yourself.<br>
  Are you a yes or a no?
  Are you going to act or not?
  Yo you've been staring
 at a computer screen
  way too long, homie.<br>
  Life's not that binary.<br>
  Isn't it?
  Sure, there are grays
  but when you come right
 down to it, at its core,
  beneath every choice, there's
 either a one or a zero.<br>
  You either do something or you don't.<br>
  You walk out that door,
 you've decided to do nothing,
  to say no, which means
 you do not come back.<br>
  You leave, you are no
 longer a part of this.<br>
  You become a zero.<br>
  If you stay,
  if you want to change the world,
  you become a yes.<br>
  You become a one.<br>
  So, I'll ask you again:
  are you a one or a zero?
  An innocent man is in
 prison because of what I did.<br>
  Come on, let's not kid ourselves!
  This has nothing to do with Colby.<br>
  This isn't even about my revolution.<br>
  This is more than that for you.<br>
  This is about how those bastards
 slowly killed your father
  and how you wished he'd
 done something about it.<br>
  But he didn't.<br> Because he was a zero,
  just like you're being right now.<br>
  Fuck you.<br>
  Disappearing again?
  I'm not killing anyone.<br>
 Leave me out of this.<br>
  You don't get to disappear from this.<br>
  We can do it with or without you,
  but you're a part of it either way!
  Yeah, even your stupid hoodie
 can't protect you, bitch!
  This was a mistake.<br>
  I've gotta turn them in.<br>
 Should I turn them in?
  Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.<br>
  I'm culpable now.<br> No, we're culpable.<br>
  You're in this with me, so
 start thinking of solutions now.<br>
  Shayla?
  Yo, Shayla.<br>
  Yo, bro.<br>
  Can I help you with something?
  I, uh just need to talk to Shayla.<br>
  Oh, your girl.<br>
  She in the tub.<br>
  Shayla.<br>
  Yo, she'll be out in a minute.<br>
  Can sit and wait if you want.<br>
  I think we should check on
 her, make sure she's all right.<br>
  You a funny dude.<br> I like you.<br>
  Don't be rude.<br>
  Sit down and chill.<br>
  No, that's right.<br>
  You only do this.<br>
  Only nigga I know that take
 withdrawal meds while he using.<br>
  That's smart.<br>
  Probably even convinced
 yourself you ain't an addict.<br>
  Oh, shit.<br>
  Forgot to introduce myself.<br> I'm Fernan
  Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier.<br>
  One of the worst human
 beings I've ever hacked.<br>
  His password? "eatadick6969.<br>"
  Aside from the massive amounts of money
  he spends on porn and webcams,
  he does all his drug transactions
  through emails, IMs, Twitter.<br>
  The fact that the cops haven't
 caught him yet is beyond me.<br>
  If they had half a brain cell,
  they'd be able to crack
 his gang's simplistic code,
  if it can even be called that.<br>
  After only a couple of
 hours of timing his tweets
  with related news articles,
  I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"
  clearly referenced guns.<br>
  "Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.<br>
  And the ultimate: "rock to sleep early.<br>"
  I haven't made the direct
 connection to a hit yet,
  but the math of guns plus bullets
  usually adds up to one thing.<br>
  I've thought about turning him in,
  but he's Shayla's only supplier.<br>
  I take him down, I lose my drugs,
  and with everything going on
 right now, I can't have that.<br>
  You get that, though?
  Anyway, bro,
  I ain't nothing to worry about.<br>
  Just making a drop for you.<br>
  What's your name, anyway?
  Elliot.<br>
  What it mean?
  What, you ain't never Googled it?
  Man, you gotta do that.<br>
  The meaning of a person's
 name is important, bro.<br>
  Yo, she good! She good.<br>
  Trust me.<br>
  Took care of that shit myself.<br>
  You remind me of me when I was younger,
  depressed and sullen.<br>
  Matter of fact, tried to kill
 myself, a couple of times.<br>
  Never could get that shit right.<br>
  Biology wasn't my strong suit.<br>
  I hated myself, man.<br> Still do.<br>
  Thought that shit was a
 weakness for a long time.<br>
  Then I realized that shit was my power.<br>
  People walk around, act like
 they know what hate means.<br>
  Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.<br>
  I mean
  truly hate yourself.<br>
  That's power.<br>
  You ain't scared of me, are you?
  That's good.<br>
  Means I didn't waste my
 time making friends with you.<br>
  You don't really need these, do you?
  Man of your courage can last
 through a little withdrawal.<br>
  Ya know, you the only
 reason why I met Shayla.<br>
  I'm the only nigga in
 town carrying everything,
  including your precious Suboxone.<br>
  So, in a weird way, I
 should be thanking you.<br>
  You brought her to me.<br>
  Your star orbiting with
 mine, gravitationally,
  brought me the love of my life, Elliot.<br>
  I mean, this, us?
  Being here?
  This has
  beautiful meaning.<br>
  But make no mistake, that girl in there
  is mine.<br>
  I don't know what I'd do without her.<br>
  Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement
  you had with her before,
 but now that we friends
  I trust you respect this boundary.<br>
  Feel me?
  A dude earlier today
 gave me that same look.<br>
  Only thing I gotta say is,
  there's a smart time to be scared, bro
  And a stupid time.<br>
  Shayla?
  The lock pick.<br>
  Every hacker's favorite sport.<br>
  The perfect system to crack,
  mostly because unlike virtual systems,
  when you break it, you can feel it.<br>
  You can see it.<br> You can hear it.<br>
  Shayla.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  Shayla.<br>
  Wake up.<br>
  Mm.<br>
  What happened?
  You okay?
  Why was that asshole here?
  Why am I in the tub?
  I don't know, um I told
 him I needed your pills.<br>
  He came over.<br> We smoked a little.<br>
  You remember having sex with him?
  What? No.<br>
  But he definitely does.<br>
  Okay, let's go.<br>
  - Get your purse, make sure
 - Stop.<br>
  I'm not going anywhere, okay?
  What do you mean?
  Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?
  You can't go back to him.<br>
 Hey, I don't need the pills.<br>
  - Just find someone else.<br>
 - I can't.<br>
  He gives me a really
 good deal on the split.<br>
  I make good money.<br>
  There it is again,
  the invisible hand at work, controlling us,
  even if it pushes us past
 our threshold of pain.<br>
  It's not gonna stop.<br>
  What if he does it again?
  Promise me you won't do anything?
  I'm serious, Elliot.<br>
  There's nothing to be done here.<br>
  It's not like I have a choice.<br>
  Hey
  Would you mind sleeping here tonight?
  Choices.<br>
  Maybe Mr.<br> Robot's right.<br>
  That's what this is all about,
 the yesses and nos of life.<br>
  But do we decide them or do they decide us?
  Fernando Vera.<br> I get rid of him,
  I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.<br>
  I get rid of the morphine.<br>
  And the pain I've been
 holding in comes rushing out.<br>
  Sure, I can try to find another dealer,
  but like Vera said, no one
 on the streets deals Suboxone.<br>
  I could go back to digitally
 counterfeiting scripts,
  but pharmas spend a lot of
 dough protecting their wares.<br>
  Most places only take paper scripts.<br>
  Continuously getting legit
 refills isn't realistic,
  and neither is being a junkie.<br>
  So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.<br>
  I know what you're thinking.<br>
 The answer's too obvious.<br>
  Vera may have been groping Shayla before,
  but he's graduated to rape.<br>
  Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.<br>
  He can't be allowed to exist anymore.<br>
  Perhaps we should start
 with how you're feeling.<br>
  Not good.<br>
  What's not good right now?
  Everything.<br>
  Humor me with some specifics.<br>
  How do we know if we're in control?
  That we're not just making the best
  of what comes at us, and that's it.<br>
  Trying to constantly
 pick between two options.<br>
  Like your two paintings
 in the waiting room.<br>
  Or Coke and Pepsi.<br>
  McDonald's or Burger King?
  Hyundai or Honda?
  Hmm.<br>
  It's all part of the same blur, right?
  Just out of focus enough.<br>
  It's the illusion of choice.<br>
  Half of us can't even pick our own
  our cable, gas, electric.<br>
  The water we drink, our health insurance.<br>
  Even if we did, would it matter?
  You know, if our only option
 is Blue Cross or Blue Shield,
  what the fuck is the difference?
  In fact, aren't they
 aren't they the same?
  No, man
  our choices are prepaid for us,
  long time ago.<br>
  I'm sorry you feel you have no control.<br>
  Thought I was doing something good.<br>
  I was a part of this project.<br>
  Thought I was going to be
 a part of something special.<br>
  - And now?
 - Now
  It turned out to be a mistake,
  like everything else.<br>
  What's the point, right?
  Might as well, just you do nothing.<br>
  Might as well do nothing.<br>
  You've brought up this issue before,
  this issue of not feeling
 like you're in control.<br>
  Do you remember?
  When we spoke about your father.<br>
  You talked about how he chose to do nothing
  when he was battling his cancer.<br>
  You told him he could have
  fought the company that caused it.<br>
  He could have told people about it.<br>
  He could have sought better
 care than what he was getting.<br>
  Instead, he did nothing.<br>
  Maybe your father felt
 the same way as you do now.<br>
  After all, like you said, what's the point?
  - It's different.<br>
 - What's different
  is you've found options, Elliot.<br>
  That's the power you have.<br>
 That's the control you own.<br>
  You don't have to just
 take what life gives you.<br>
  Come on.<br>
  Tell me what is going on with you.<br>
  I cannot help you if
 you keep me in the dark.<br>
  Shut up!
  Shut up!
  You've got bags under your eyes.<br>
  You're yelling.<br> You're jittery.<br>
  For the last month, I have seen you
  slip into old patterns, old behaviors.<br>
  What is going on?
  He's still not answering.<br>
  Well, we'll just have to ask him tomorrow.<br>
  Every time I try to play it or rip it,
  it just freezes up my computer
 and spits it back out again.<br>
  He's not okay.<br>
  He was acting so out of it at work today.<br>
  Um
  Are you saying something, babe?
  Something's wrong.<br>
  Should I go over there?
  And just
  Check in on him?
  Uh come on.<br>
  That's ridiculous.<br>
  You know he's always been a weirdo, right?
  I'm really worried about him.<br>
  Um
  My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.<br>
  He wants to grab a drink.<br>
  Shouldn't take too long.<br>
  Okay.<br>
    - Nice one, bro.<br>
 - Nice.<br>
  "Deep passions, longing
  The two of them had
 never felt such a love,
  such closeness, such a connection.<br>"
  - Found a way to do it without
 - Shh!
  Sit down.<br>
  I know how to take out the backups
  without blowing up the pipeline.<br>
  You know, Elliot, I really
 feel like we resolved
  this thing between us.<br>
 Didn't you walk away?
  - I did.<br>
 - Didn't I say
  that if you walked away,
  you were no longer a part of this?
  I have a real plan
  If you want me to let you back in,
  there's an understanding
 we have to come to,
  a debt you have to pay,
  because, remember, you walked away.<br>
  I thought you didn't believe in debts.<br>
  Not true.<br> I believe in debts.<br>
  I believe in erasing them.<br>
  What do you want?
  I want you to tell me about your father.<br>
  You're not gonna get into my head, man.<br>
  Your David Koresh shit
 isn't gonna work on me.<br>
  Tell me how he died.<br>
  Why, man? Something tells me
  you already looked that shit up anyway.<br>
  I wanna hear it from you.<br>
  So I do this
  we go back to the arcade,
  discuss the plan with the rest of them?
  I don't know what you want me to say.<br>
  We were close.<br> Very close.<br>
  He was my best friend.<br>
  Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.<br>
  He was one of the best
 computer engineers they had.<br>
  And out of the blue, he got fired.<br>
  No one knew why.<br>
  Then one day he told me.<br>
  He had leukemia.<br>
  Made me swear to never tell anyone,
  especially my mom.<br>
  So I didn't.<br>
  A few months go by
  he got sicker and sicker.<br>
  Finally, I got so worried
  told my mom.<br>
  When he found out, he got pissed.<br>
  Started yelling.<br>
  I remember I tried to hug
 him, tell him I'm sorry, and
  kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard
  I fell backwards out the window.<br>
  I fell, and I broke my arm.<br>
  Never spoke to me after that.<br>
  Couldn't even look at me.<br>
  Even the night he died.<br>
  We good?
  I understand what it's
 like to lose a parent.<br>
  It's heartbreaking.<br>
  Did you ever think he was right?
  About what?
  Hurting you that day?
  For what you did to him?
  You ever think you deserved it?
  I didn't do anything to him.<br>
  I was trying to help him.<br>
  For betraying his trust.<br>
  I was eight years ol
  You didn't commit to the
 sacred pact you'd formed.<br>
      <br>
