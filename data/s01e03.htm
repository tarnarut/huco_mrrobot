                    			I will be the youngest executive
 this company has ever seen.<br>
  All right, you know, I'll take
 it if you leave us alone.<br>
  All right? Thank you.<br>
 Check track two out.<br>
  - I will, track two.<br>
 - All right, man.<br>
  Why didn't you tell me
 about the DAT file?
  Worked at Evil Corp
 his whole life.<br>
  Then out of the blue, he got fired.<br>
 No one knew why.<br>
  He had leukemia.<br> Made me
 swear to never tell anyone.<br>
  Finally, I got so worried,
 told my mom.<br>
  And when he found out,
 he got pissed.<br>
  You ever
 think you deserved it?
  I was eight years old.<br>
  You didn't commit to the
 sacred pact you had formed.<br>
  My approach
 within our business units,
  is to first invest in new
 technologies and develop prototypes
  in order to understand
 the technology potential.<br>
  Because despite the recent success
 of our cybersecurity team,
  our company currently still has
  seventy-two potential
 hacker vulnerabilities
  in our primary and second
 No, wait a second
  You stupid piece of shit.<br>
  Again.<br>
  Our company currently still has
 73 potential hacker vulnerabilities
  in our primary
 and secondary data centers.<br>
  Now is not the time
 to be encumbered
  by the company's tragic and
 shameful loss of our chief tech
  Too formal, God damn it!
  Warm it up,
 don't be a cold robot.<br>
  Again!
 Now is not the time
  to be encumbered by the company's
 tragic and shameful loss
  of our Chief Technology Officer.<br>
  We have to be swift
 in naming a replacement CTO.<br>
  And, sir, I would like
 to suggest it be me.<br>
  For the sake of our company
  that we make our decision today.<br>
  My promotion
  My internal promotion shows not
 only our confidence as a company,
  but strength in our boldness
 to the public.<br>
  Thank you for your time.<br>
  You will be the next CTO
 of this company.<br>
  You will be the
 next CTO of this company.<br>
  You will be
 the next CTO of this company.<br>
  You sure you don't want
 anything? Pellegrino? Tea?
  Sir, thank you again
 for seeing me.<br>
  Tyrell, I'm gonna have
 to reschedule this.<br>
  - Anwar, set up another time.<br>
 - Sir, it's just that I think that
  I get it, I get it.<br> We'll get another
 meeting on the books right away.<br>
  We've got a really good
 CTO candidate
  the board is very excited about.<br>
  They're not ready
 to discuss it yet.<br>
  We'll loop you in.<br>
  Just give us a couple
 of weeks.<br> Hmm?
  Uh, put Wellick back
 on the books.<br> Two weeks.<br>
  Oh, nice tie.<br>
  Let me guess.<br> Brioni?
  Great taste, as always.<br>
  Be well.<br>
  I'll email
 your assistant the details.<br>
  If you could,
  just email it to me directly.<br>
  This is too important
 for me to miss.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
  Mr.<br> Wellick, we're here.<br>
  Do you think I could have
 300 this time?
  Spoken like a true capitalist.<br>
  Bad day at the office?
  No kicking
  Argh.<br> Please.<br>
 Enough.<br> No more.<br>
  Most coders think debugging
 software is about fixing a mistake,
  but that's bullshit.<br>
  Debugging's actually all about
 finding the bug.<br>
  About understanding why the
 bug was there to begin with.<br>
  About knowing that its
 existence was no accident.<br>
  It came to you
 to deliver a message,
  like an unconscious bubble
 floating to the surface,
  popping with a revelation you've
 secretly known all along.<br>
  I don't know
 why I'm saying all of this.<br>
  Maybe it's because I'm pumped up on
 whatever smack legal drug dealers
  like Eli Lilly make
 money off nowadays.<br>
  But usually it's because
 there's a sense it's coming.<br>
  A bug buzzing its way towards me
  to gum up the works until it
 forces me to make a call.<br>
  "Kill me or embrace me.<br>"
  Or maybe I'm just freaking out
 because I never thought I'd wake up
  to find these two women
 staring back at me.<br>
  Are you awake?
  I don't know.<br>
  What are you doing here?
  We talked, maybe a few hours
 ago when I first got here.<br>
  You don't remember?
  They said I was your
 emergency contact.<br>
  Um, all right.<br> Um
  You told them to call
 your psychiatrist.<br>
  You can't leave until
 you talk to one.<br>
  So I'm gonna wait outside.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  Do you remember requesting me
 from the staff?
  You requested me because
 the police said that
  I got jumped by a bunch of kids.<br>
  It's not the end of the world.<br>
  They wanted to do a full
 drug panel and you refused.<br>
  May I ask why?
  Elliot, if we can't have
 a conversation about this
  I've been taking morphine.<br>
  Why?
  I don't have a good enough
 reason to give you.<br>
  I Wish I did, but I don't.<br>
  Maybe we should consider rehab.<br>
  I'm not a junkie.<br>
  Then you'll need
 to prove it to me.<br>
  Submit to a bimonthly
 drug test.<br> Voluntarily.<br>
  That's the only way that
 I'll recommend your release.<br>
  Hospitals, a heavily
 networked one like this
  are almost too easy to hack.<br>
  This is William Highsmith.<br>
  He's not only the head
 of the IT department here,
  he is the IT department.<br>
  He's also an idiot.<br>
  Not that I blame him because the
 people that hire him are also idiots.<br>
  The poor guy only gets a budget
 of about 7,000 bucks a year.<br>
  And he's supposed to protect their
 network from people like me?
  He never stood a chance.<br>
  He uses useless virus scans, dated
 servers, and security software
  that runs on Windows 98.<br>
  It's one of the reasons why I made
 this place my primary care facility.<br>
  I can make my health records look like
 every other obedient zombie out there.<br>
  Okay.<br> You don't
 have to worry.<br>
  I'm not going to do
 morphine again.<br>
  That's a nice breakfast.<br>
  Sorry, credit card system
 is down.<br>
  Like I said, the most
 difficult thing about debugging
  isn't fixing the bug,
  it's all about finding the bug.<br>
  For Evil Corp, Mr.<br> Robot
 found that bug in me.<br>
  I was the mistake
 that led to all of this.<br>
  I have to ask
 you one thing.<br>
  Did you have something to do
 with Vera getting busted?
  Shit, Elliot.<br>
  You said you weren't
 gonna do anything.<br>
  He's on murder charges,
 do you know that?
  His whole crew bounced.<br>
 I mean, I
  I don't know what I'm
 gonna do for money now.<br>
  Just tell me, Elliot.<br>
  And don't lie.<br>
  Did you do something?
  No.<br>
  Hmm.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  Are you okay?
  - I mean with everything that
 happened to - I'm fine.<br>
  What happened to your door?
  You're not supposed to be here.<br>
  Okay, I changed the locks
 for a reason.<br>
  Mmm.<br>
  Interesting toy,
  but you may want to spend a little more
 scratch if you actually want it to,
  you know, work.<br>
  Check it,
  Jessica Alba says she wants
 to join fsociety.<br>
  Jesus, what happened
 to your face?
  What's going on?
  Well, I'm not
 the princess of social graces,
  but typically it goes
 something like,
  "Hi, this is Darlene"
  Stop.<br>
  You need to leave.<br>
  Babe, seriously, we have a lot of shit
 to discuss, so if you wouldn't mind
  Get out.<br>
  I suggest you get a grip.<br>
  I mean, what was
 she talking about?
  I gotta get to work.<br>
  Work? Are you serious?
 You can't go to work.<br>
  You have to call in sick.<br>
  I have to go.<br>
  A bug is never
 just a mistake.<br>
  It represents something bigger.<br>
  An error of thinking
  Sir!
  that makes you who you are.<br>
 Sir! Sir!
  Sir, you
 dropped your wallet!
  Thanks.<br>
 Sure.<br>
  Stop! Stop!
 He stole my purse!
  That was your wallet?
  Yes, that was my wallet
 you just gave him.<br>
  Stop!
  He got
 into my system.<br>
  And he wants me to put the CD on
 one of the computers at work.<br>
  Why does he wanna do that?
  I don't know, Stella,
  he didn't give me
 a full explanation.<br>
  So, he's got naked pics of me?
  Is that the only thing you're seriously
 taking away from this conversation?
  Hey, babe.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  How was your run?
  Strange.<br>
  Someone dropped their wallet.<br>
  And I picked it up to give
 it to them, but then this
  Nothing strange about that, just
 shows how good of a person you are.<br>
  Always have been.<br> Almost to a fault.<br>
  What does that mean?
  Just that you
  You're too good for the world.<br>
  That's probably why I love you.<br>
  I'm gonna hop in the shower.<br>
  I told you I can't talk.<br>
  You have 100 hours precisely.<br>
  After that,
  everything we own
 will be released.<br>
  And it's not enough just to
 focus your attention on the logs.<br>
  We should also monitor social-media
 traffic, as well as IRC, Pastebin.<br>
  And set up scripts
 to keep going 24/7.<br>
  We might get lucky,
  we might get sloppy, make a
 mistake, you know, catch some
  This is the world
 we live in,
  people relying on
 each other's mistakes
  to manipulate one another,
 use one another,
  even relate to one another.<br>
  The warm, messy circle
 of humanity.<br>
  Elliot?
  I'm inviting you guys,
 uh, to dinner tonight.<br>
  Morton's notwithstanding,
 I cook a mean steak.<br>
  What? Can't a boss invite his
 favorite employees to dinner?
  No, that's cool,
 but I got plans.<br>
  Can you guys give us a minute?
  Yeah.<br>
  You wanna tell me
 what's going on?
  Not really.<br>
 Well
  You're missing work,
 you come in looking like that,
  and you expect me
 not to ask questions?
  Look, I don't know how much you want
 me asking about your personal life.<br>
  But
 Not at all, actually.<br>
  I mean, I don't mean
 to be rude, just
  I'm just being honest.<br>
  Mr.<br> Robot may have
 found Evil Corp's bug,
  but he didn't find mine.<br>
  That's the only way
 to protect myself,
  never show them my source code.<br>
  Close myself off.<br>
  Create my cold, perfect maze
 where no one can ever find me.<br>
  Elliot! I cannot believe you work here.<br>
 This place is a shithole!
  Look, I thought I'd
 swing by, take you to lunch.<br>
  Oh, that's nice.<br>
  I think she likes you, bud.<br>
  All right, fine, I'll take her.<br>
  But let the record show, I was
 trying to be a good wing man.<br>
  Oh, calm down! Shit.<br>
  I'm not that into
 redheads anyway.<br>
  The whole nation of Ireland
 makes my dick soft.<br>
  Leave.<br>
  Darlene said we need to talk.<br>
  Leave, now.<br>
  You're right,
 probably shouldn't talk here.<br>
  Let's go to that bar next door.<br>
  I'm not going anywhere with you.<br>
  I'm not going anywhere
 until you do.<br>
  So, I can hang out here
 and create a scene,
  or you can give me five
 minutes in the bar next door.<br>
  Either way, I'm gonna have fun.<br>
 Dealer's choice.<br>
  Mmm.<br>
  What? It's an appletini.<br>
  I should kick your ass.<br>
  Mmm.<br> If that'll make us
 square, you have my blessing.<br>
  Nah, man, I want nothing to do with you.<br>
 You're a maniac.<br>
  What can I get for you?
  Uh, nothing.<br>
  Uh, you should probably order something.<br>
 I'd recommend this.<br>
  Fine.<br>
  I'll, I'll have a
  Appletini.<br>
  You should it as a compliment, guy,
 these things are goddamn delicious.<br>
  I get it, compliments
 make me uncomfortable, too.<br>
  You know, I find that hard to believe.<br>
  Yeah, who am I kidding?
 I love compliments.<br>
  $12.<br>
  I really don't think you enjoyed that.<br>
 I suggest sipping it
  Last chance.<br>
  What do you want?
  I'm sorry for what I did.<br>
  I don't buy it.<br>
  More importantly,
 I don't give a shit.<br>
  Hey, I never wanted to hurt you.<br>
  People who get violent, get that way
 because they can't communicate.<br>
  Your dad
  I bet he felt shitty
 for doing what he did.<br>
  I'm sure he wanted
 to apologize, too.<br>
  Sometimes pushing your kid
 away is just easier.<br>
  Don't stay mad
 at him too long, kiddo.<br>
  You're leaving?
  That's what you want, isn't it?
  What about your plan?
  Plan?
  You're the key
 to the whole thing.<br>
  Without you, there is no plan.<br>
  That's it?
  It's over?
  You expect me to believe that?
  See you in another life.<br>
  Did you hear that?
  I can't believe it.<br>
  Is that really happening?
  Fsociety's finally over.<br>
  The recent glitch in the otherwise
 neat reality I created over the years,
  I'll never slip
 up like that again.<br>
  I'm gonna be more normal now.<br>
  Maybe Shayla could
 even be my girlfriend.<br>
  I'll go see those stupid
 Marvel movies with her.<br>
  I'll join a gym.<br>
  I'll heart things on Instagram.<br>
  I'll drink vanilla lattes.<br>
  I'm gonna lead
 a bug-free life from now on.<br>
  Anything to protect
 my perfect maze.<br>
  Hey, Gideon.<br>
  Is that dinner
 still on for tonight?
  Um, yeah, sure.<br>
  Uh, uh, you want
 You want to come?
  Yeah.<br>
  Great.<br>
  Can I bring my girlfriend?
  You have a girlfriend?
  Well, I haven't
 asked her yet, but I will.<br>
  Hopefully she'll say "yes.<br>"
  Uh, yeah, sure.<br>
  Perfect.<br>
  Thanks.<br>
  Was he drinking Starbucks?
  Are you still trying
 to rip that CD?
  Yeah, it's all scratched up.<br>
  Let's get outta here.<br>
  My boss invited me to a dinner
 party at his place tonight.<br>
  Thought you could come
 as my girlfriend.<br>
  What?
  Are you actually asking me to
 be your girlfriend right now?
  Yeah.<br>
  Anyway, I need you.<br> I'm not good
 in social situations like that.<br>
  There is something
 seriously wrong with you.<br>
  I'm I'm not
 gonna be used anymore.<br>
  Why don't you ask the girl
 from this morning, okay?
  She seems like she might wanna go to
 some stupid, stuffy dinner party.<br>
  You don't actually know me.<br>
  All you know is that I'm
  Of course I know Shayla.<br>
  I hacked her email as soon
 as she moved in next door.<br>
  With a simple phishing scam, I
 owned her password pretty easily.<br>
  I'm not talking about
 the stuff you can find online.<br>
  I'm talking about the real me.<br>
  Tell me then.<br>
  No.<br> Forget it.<br>
  I wanna know.<br>
  What is this?
  It's beautiful.<br>
  I've never seen
 this before, she must
  never posted online.<br> Um,
 I mean, a lot of 'ems not
  They're not done.<br>
  She's got
 her own private maze, too.<br>
  Took a lot of different pieces,
 um, from different things.<br>
  From my photographs
 or drawings.<br> And
  Like, there's this one.<br>
  Um, it's really fucking corny.<br>
  But it's like Has everything.<br>
 The kids and the
  Shayla 's bug was
 always elusive to me.<br>
  Maybe this was it,
  wanting normalcy, but stuck
 in the outer fringes.<br>
  Not knowing how to participate.<br>
  Just like me.<br>
  Can I kiss you?
  Next time, don't ask.<br>
  It's lame.<br>
  Bugs usually get
 a bad rep.<br>
  But sometimes
  Don't let me down, okay?
  When a bug finally
 makes itself known,
  it can be exhilarating.<br>
  Like you just
 unlocked something.<br>
  A grand opportunity waiting
 to be taken advantage of.<br>
  Mr.<br> Wellick?
  Hey.<br>
  What was your name again?
  Anwar.<br>
  I didn't know you came
 to places like this.<br>
  I don't.<br>
  What do you mean?
 You're here now.<br>
  I'm here because you are.<br>
  What? I'm sorry,
 I don't get it.<br>
  I think you're beautiful.<br>
 I wanna take you home.<br>
  Wait, I thought
 you were married.<br>
  Because, after all,
 a bug's only purpose,
  its only reason for existence,
  is to be a mistake
 that needs fixing.<br>
  To help you right a wrong.<br>
  And what feels better than that?
  So, Elliot,
  do you think you
 should introduce us?
  Oh, um, Shayla,
  Angela and Ollie.<br>
  You, uh You look
 lovely this evening.<br>
  What up guys?
  You just get here?
  Nice suit.<br>
  Thanks, dude.<br>
  What is up with you?
  You've been fidgeting all night.<br>
  Maybe we should try
 the doorbell again.<br>
  Hey guys!
  How have you been
 standing out here?
  The doorbell is broken.<br>
 I should have warned you.<br>
  Come in!
 I'm Harry, by the way.<br>
  Angela.<br> Nice to meet you.<br>
 Nice to meet you.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  Always nice to put a face
 with an employee badge number.<br>
  Right?
  Ollie, how long have
 you guys been together?
  Uh, two and a half years.<br>
 Two years.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  Elliot, how long have
 you and Shayla been together?
  Well, uh
  Um, just Just today.<br>
  Okay, enough grilling
 of the guests.<br>
  Let's check on
 the real grill, shall we?
  Elliot, I could use your help.<br>
  So, I have a confession.<br>
  I had the sys admins of the data center
 in Dulles check that server again.<br>
  Gideon, what did you do?
  Of course, there was nothing.<br>
  I have no idea what there was
 to even be suspicious about.<br>
  I mean, what possible motivation
 would you have to do anything?
  Gideon has to let this go.<br>
  If he comes
 near this hornet's nest,
  I'm not sure
 I can save him from it.<br>
  I have to kill
 any suspicion left.<br>
  You've been nothing,
 but a hard worker for Allsafe.<br>
  So,
  I apologize.<br>
  After the conversation
 on the plane,
  I knew what was at stake.<br>
  The whole company.<br>
  I was worried that the DAT file
 I found wasn't the right one,
  and I just didn't want to get your
 hopes up in case I was wrong.<br>
  That's why I didn't tell you
 before the meeting.<br>
  Shit, I'm gonna have
 to let him hug me, aren't I?
  You're such
 a brilliant engineer, Elliot.<br>
  You should never doubt
 your skills,
  no matter how much
 pressure I put on you.<br>
  And you certainly don't have
 to keep anything from me.<br>
  I care about you.<br>
  From the Mixed-Up Files
 of Basil E.<br> Frankweiler.<br>
  That's where I got
 the idea, remember?
  I wanted to be
 Claudia Kincaid so bad.<br>
  Even her name was cool.<br>
  Remember, we thought we were
 going to the Met,
  somehow we ended up at the
 Queens Museum instead.<br>
  No Google Maps back then.<br>
  I loved running away with you.<br>
  Somehow, when you're eight,
 running away can be fun.<br>
  The normal life.<br>
  Smiles,
 dinner parties,
  childhood stories.<br>
  I could get used to this,
  maybe even like it.<br>
  What's wrong?
  Evil
 Corp's hacking scandal continues
  with the release
 of these latest emails.<br>
  Information stemming from
 the latest dump reveals
  that Terry Colby was one of three
 high-level executives involved
  in the cover-up
 of the widely publicized
  Washington Township
 Toxic Waste Scandal.<br>
  If these reports are true, Colby
 may be facing more indictments.<br>
  In the ensuing 24 months after the
 alleged toxic waste leak in 1993,
  26 employees died from
 similar types of leukemia.<br>
  Evil Corp, however, managed to
 get the class action lawsuit
  filed against it by the
 surviving victims dismissed,
  claiming there was no direct evidence
 linking their factories to the diagnoses.<br>
  Now, these emails indicate
 that Colby was in fact aware
  of the dangerous
 levels of toxicity
  and kept it a secret, as it quote,
 "Would not be cost-effective
  "to retool the current systems in place,
 even if there are potential lawsuits.<br>"
  End quote.<br>
  Mr.<br> Colby was unavailable for
 comment, but his lawyers
  My perfect maze
  crumbling before my eyes.<br>
  data dump are
 further proof Colby was set up.<br>
  But they didn't
 indicate by whom.<br>
  There's nothing
 to hide behind.<br>
  I didn't think it existed,
 but there it was, is.<br>
  Mr.<br> Robot
 finally found my bug.<br>
  linking the waste levels in
 Washington Township to the victim's illnesses.<br>
  Legal analysts support the claim that
 there is not enough evidence to
  What's going on?
  That's how my mom,
 um, and Elliot's dad
  I have to go.<br>
  Well, wait Wait,
 let me come with you.<br>
  No, I'd rather you didn't.<br>
  Evidence in the
 Washington Township scandal.<br>
  Terry Colby remains
 under investigation
  for his alleged involvement
  with the Evil Corp executives
  because there was no evidence
 linking the waste dump to leukemia.<br>
  Evil Corp is dangerous
  Don't look so sad.<br>
  He did this to himself.<br>
 He gave in.<br> He was a coward.<br>
  He was weak and pathetic,
  and, in the end, that's
 what killed your father.<br>
  Why are you crying?
  Don't ask so many questions.<br>
  I miss him.<br>
  There's no point to that.<br>
  But I do.<br>
  Then you're just as weak as him.<br>
  You're not sad?
  Why should I be?
  It's a beautiful night.<br>
  The weather is nice.<br>
  And I'm enjoying my cigarette.<br>
  The bug forces
 the software to adapt,
  evolving something new
 because of it.<br>
  Work around it or work through it
  No matter what, it changes,
  it becomes something new,
  the next version,
  the inevitable upgrade.<br>
  You're a strange creature.<br>
  I'm just a businessman.<br>
  And that's about as clean
 as I'm gonna get it.<br>
  You have to do the rest
 in the shower.<br>
  I don't mind
 being a little dirty.<br>
  I do.<br>
  You should join me!
  Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  I'm sorry
 that I ran off like that.<br>
  Did you talk to him?
  Nope.<br> He wasn't home.<br>
  Well, I'm here.<br>
  I want to talk to you about
 everything, just not tonight, okay?
  So, you'd talk to him,
 but not your own boyfriend?
  It's different, Ollie.<br>
  Both of our parents
 died because
  That's how we know each other.<br>
  I really don't wanna talk
 about this right now.<br>
  Well, what if I do?
  What if you do what?
  Wanna talk!
  About
  Something.<br>
  What the hell
 are you talking about?
  I have to tell you something.<br>
  I don't know why you're
 You're putting yourself through this,
  you don't have to keep
 looking at it.<br>
  All right? It meant nothing.<br>
  Okay, I know I sound like a
 broken record, but I love you,
  and I wanna be with you.<br>
 Stop speaking.<br>
  Just tell me what you need
 in order for me to fix this,
  and I'll do it.<br>
  We need to break up.<br>
  Angela, come on.<br>
  What choice
 did you give me, Ollie?
  Look, I know I have a problem,
  I'm not denying that.<br>
 Well maybe my problem is
  I can't be
 with a guy with your problem.<br>
  Where's the CD?
  It's in my
 In my bag.<br> Why?
  He has my bank account, Ollie.<br>
 And my dad's bank account.<br>
  How did they
 Our accounts are linked
  because of my student loans.<br> I
 used your laptop to access it.<br>
  He has my dad's social security,
  his credit card numbers,
 everything.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  Okay, that is bad, but I'm But I'm
 sure the cops will figure out a way
  If we don't do what this guy
 says and we go to the oops,
  then he's just gonna sell our
 information to the highest bidder,
  and me and my dad
 are completely screwed.<br>
  Do you have any idea
 how difficult it is
  to come back from massive
 identity theft like this?
  What are you saying?
  Angela? Are you crazy?
  No.<br> We cannot just infect Allsafe's

  I'll lose my job!
  And there it is.<br>
  You'll lose your job too,
 if that matters.<br>
  Besides, even if we put
 the CD in,
  who says this guy won't
 just do all of this anyway?
  Hey.<br> Hey, hey.<br>
 Come here.<br>
  Look at me.<br>
  We are going to figure this out.<br>
  Okay?
  You're right.<br>
 You're right.<br>
  I'm sorry.<br>
 I'm just scared.<br>
  I don't wanna break up
 with you.<br> I'm sorry that I said that.<br>
  I love you so much.<br>
  This is Edmond Dulles.<br>
  Yeah, hi.<br> This, um, Gideon
 Goddard at Allsafe Security.<br>
  I need to talk to Sean Skyler
 about server CS30 again.<br>
  Hold please.<br>
 I'll transfer you.<br>
  Mmm-hmm.<br>
  Here's the plan.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
