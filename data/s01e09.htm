                    			Exciting time in
 the world right now.<br>
  Exciting time.<br>
  If you agree to testify,
  I will testify that I broke chain
 of custody with the .<br>DAT file.<br>
  We've implemented
 a honeypot, CS30.<br>
  I'd like to look over
 your findings,
  especially this server.<br>
  Detectives came by.<br>
 They wanna speak with you.<br>
  They found a body on the roof.<br>
  And you both did know
 the deceased, Sharon Knowles?
  Sharon Knowles?
  I think
 the baby's coming.<br>
  We got to get her
 to the hospital.<br>
  Tell me about your father.<br>
  I remember I tried to hug
 him, tell him I'm sorry,
  and he shoved me so hard, I
 fell backwards out the window.<br>
  On, my God, Elliot!
  Did you forget again?
  Did you forget who I am?
  I'm your
 - Sister.<br>
  I think we should talk.<br>
  It hasn't
 happened since 1904,
  the year John McGraw decided to
 take his bat and ball and go home.<br>
  Here we are 90 years later
 and I wanna get your thoughts
  on what it was like to be
 without the 1994 World Series.<br>
  That's right.<br> The 1994
 World Series is canceled.<br>
  Mr.<br> Robot.<br>
  Um, well, I'd recommend
 the Pentium 90.<br>
  They're lightning fast, and
 we've got some in stock now.<br>
  With an 800 megabyte hard drive,
  you'll be all set.<br>
  Or we could you save you a few
 bucks and upgrade what you have.<br>
  Once we swap out that
 motherboard and hard drive,
  um, you'll be better than new.<br>
  Why don't you, uh, bring it on
 by and we'll, we'll take a look.<br>
  Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> Bye-bye.<br>
  What happened? That new mouse
 not work out for you?
  Your son.<br>
 He stole money from me.<br>
  Uh, excuse me?
  Your son stole money from me!
  I pulled out my wallet, I specifically
 remembered I had three 20s.<br>
  And now I only have one.<br>
  I used one to pay for the
 mouse, and then I had two left.<br>
  Your son was standing
 right behind me
  when I had my money
 out on the counter.<br>
  I Just calm down.<br>
  I'm sure there's
 an explanation for this.<br>
  I don't want an explanation!
  The only thing I want from you is
 my money and a fucking apology!
  There's no need for that.<br> I'm
 just trying to figure it out.<br>
  Can you tell how much of a
 shit I give about that?
  Ugh
 I don't have time for this.<br>
  Are you giving me
 my money or not?
  Look, do the right
 thing here, guy.<br>
  Then, no.<br>
  Excuse me?
  The answer is no.<br>
  Are you You being
 serious right now?
  I can't help you.<br>
  You're really
 just gonna sit there and lie?
  I should call the cops!
  What
  What an example you're setting.<br>
  I, learned my money,
  and you're just teaching
 him how to steal.<br>
  You're a terrible father.<br>
  I'm gonna have
 to ask you to leave.<br>
  You're a nobody.<br>
  You're a middle-aged man
  doing what my retarded nephew
 could do.<br>
  That's your life.<br>
  You know what?
 Keep your 20.<br>
  I'll just go to Best Buy
 from now on.<br>
  God.<br>
  Come on out.<br>
  Dad, I didn't do it.<br>
  Let me see it.<br>
  Timecop or Stargate?
  What? 20 bucks ought to cover
 the both of us.<br>
  Pulp Fiction?
 Never heard of it.<br>
  You sure I can take you to that?
  All right, get your jacket.<br>
  What?
  How come I'm not in trouble?
  Even though
 what you did was wrong,
  you're still a good kid.<br>
  And that guy was a prick.<br>
  Sometimes that matters more.<br>
  Come on.<br> Let's go.<br>
 It starts in 15 minutes,
  and I wanna get
 some popcorn.<br> Come on.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
  It's really him.<br>
  It's really you.<br>
  I haven't been
 to your apartment before.<br>
  It's nice.<br>
  A little messy
  but that's not
 earth-shattering news.<br>
  You never really did
 like cleaning your room.<br>
  Jesus fucking Christ.<br>
  I can't believe it's really you.<br>
  I was beginning to wonder
 how long it was gonna take
  before you recognized me.<br>
  Now, the fact that you've stopped
 recognizing Darlene, too, well
  I gotta be honest, that's
 a little disconcerting.<br>
  - Argh! -  Why
 didn't you say anything?
  Why didn't you tell me?
  Okay, Elliot.<br>
 - This whole time!
  Elliot.<br>
 You are not well.<br>
  I was trying
 to handle it gently.<br>
  Gently?
  Gently?
  Gently?
  Is that what the last
 three months have been?
  No.<br>
  It's been about us
 doing something important.<br>
  And that's what it still needs
 to be about.<br>
  You died.<br>
  You died.<br>
  You were dead!
  I suggest you lower your voice.<br>
  Lower my voice?
  You want me to lower my voice
  after appearing at my door
  20 years after
 your supposed death.<br>
  I think this is
  a perfect fucking volume!
  Elliot, you don't
 want them to hear us.<br>
  Especially after my impromptu visit
 from Tyrell Wellick last night.<br>
  Elliot, there are
 people out there
  who do not want us
 to work together.<br>
  Is that why
 they've been following me?
  Is that why?
  Because of you?
  Think about it.<br>
  You don't remember me, you don't
 remember your own goddamn sister.<br>
  You see that shrink,
 pop their pills.<br>
  They intentionally
 put you in this haze,
  fog up whatever brain matter
 you have left in there
  so you forget
 what they want you to forget.<br>
  They're trying
 to control you, Elliot.<br>
  They've been trying
 to control you all along.<br>
  This is crazy.<br>
  I'm crazy.<br>
  I'm crazy.<br> You're crazy.<br>
 This is crazy.<br>
  What are you talking about?
  Who's trying to control me?
  The people out there
 who don't want me alive.<br>
  The people who are afraid of us.<br>
  We have to be more careful
 now, more than ever.<br>
  And Darlene?
  She knew about this?
  Elliot, I will
 explain everything,
  but right now, tonight,
 we have to stick to the plan.<br>
  Are you kidding me?
  You want me to put this on hold?
  Are you out of
 your goddamn mind?
  It's not safe
 to discuss this here.<br>
  I don't give a shit!
  Tell me what the fuck
 is going on.<br>
  All right.<br>
 Come on, let's go.<br>
  Where?
  You want answers?
  Stop asking questions
 and follow me.<br>
  Oh, that's sweet,
 I I can't.<br>
  You're going too fast.<br>
  Trust me, I don't think
 that's the problem.<br>
  Hey, I know you didn't
 want to talk last night.<br>
  No, Harry, I I can't
 right now, I have to
  Breathe and have some
 breakfast in bed with me.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  How are you enjoying
 anything like that?
  Hmm.<br>
  Mmm.<br>
  Honey, I appreciate it, I
  God, if you only knew.<br>
  Tell me.<br>
 I would love to know.<br>
  They hacked us.<br> You know that,
 it's all over the news.<br>
  Now, normally, a company
 can get through this,
  but we're
 a cyber security company.<br>
  Can you appreciate
 how bad that is?
  We're hanging on
 by our fingernails.<br>
  Uh, who knows?
  Maybe we've already
 fallen off a cliff
  and I'm still trying
 to grasp onto something.<br>
  I'm a failure.<br>
  Look at me.<br>
  Look at this person
 who loves you so much
  he would die a happy man right
 now just 'cause he had this.<br>
  Us, sitting down,
 having breakfast.<br>
  I don't think failing
 looks like this.<br>
  Hmm?
  Make sure you go through
 all those emails again.<br>
  Everything from '91 to '95.<br>
  And let's start building a table
 that cross-references our calendar.<br>
  Yes.<br>
  Hey!
 Good to see you.<br>
  Uh, you should be proud.<br>
  News of Colby's confession
 is breaking today.<br>
  So far, we are firing
 on all cylinders.<br>
  So, what's up?
  I came to help out.<br>
  Yeah.<br> Can we scan these and,
 uh, email the PDFs to me.<br>
  And copy Roy on them.<br>
  Shouldn't you be at work?
  I quit.<br>
  Angela.<br>
  You can't work here.<br>
  Why not?
  I gave up everything
 for this case.<br>
  I don't want you to.<br>
  I am not here to help you
 find purpose in your life.<br>
  If you need something to
 do, take a jewelry class.<br>
  But you can't work here.<br>
  After what I did,
  I won't be able to find
 another job in tech.<br>
  I'm broke.<br>
  The lawsuit money
 won't come in for years.<br>
  Which is why you need to
 find something you can get.<br>
  But this is not it.<br>
  Not at this level,
 for what we're trying to do.<br>
  Hello?
  John.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br>
 No, tell me.<br>
  Um, four?
  No, no, no, no.<br> We're not We're
 not going down that road.<br>
  Absolutely not.<br>
  It's not happening.<br>
  No, it's gonna be six
 or nothing.<br>
  Who is this?
  It's me.<br>
 I'm looking for Elliot.<br>
  He's not at work.<br>
  I think he's flipping out again.<br>
  What do you mean?
  He tried to kiss me last night.<br>
  You're the one that found him
 last time he was like this.<br>
  I really need your help.<br>
  Okay.<br> Where are you?
  He's not here.<br>
  Let's keep
 thinking, then.<br>
  I have been.<br>
  This was our runaway hideout.<br>
  He always came here.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  Let's spitball together.<br>
  I can't help you.<br>
  What does that mean?
  It means
  I don't really know
 Elliot anymore.<br>
  He has gone psycho
 legit this time, Angela.<br>
  We are in a state of 911.<br>
  We just need to talk to him.<br>
  Yeah, well, he doesn't
 wanna talk back.<br>
  And if he does, it's usually
 with a bunch of lies.<br>
  We can't keep protecting
 him from himself, Darlene.<br>
  He has saved our asses
 multiple times,
  and you're just
 gonna do him like this?
  Why do you even care?
  What is that supposed to mean?
  It means you guys
 were never that close.<br>
  In fact
  He's been doing just fine until
 you moved back to the city.<br>
  Why are you even here?
  Why have you and Elliot been
 spending so much time together?
  Okay.<br> You need
 to back off, babe.<br>
  He is my brother and I'm just
 trying to help.<br>
  That requires no explanation.<br>
  You don't wanna tell me what's
 really going on here, that's fine.<br>
  But then stop asking
 me for my help.<br>
  I think we're good.<br>
  You remember this?
  Of course I do.<br>
  I think it's reasonable for
 me to confirm given your
  I even remember my game.<br>
  I'd calculate
 the statistical probability
  of safety for each car
 on the train
  based on how often
 they would derail.<br>
  On the way there, I'd
 always pick the safest car
  'cause I looked forward to our
 trips to the city so much.<br>
  Then, on the way back, I'd
 pick the most dangerous ones
  because I hated going home.<br>
  She's not there anymore, Elliot.<br>
  Look, I don't know where we're
 going, but we need to find Darlene.<br>
  They may be after her.<br>
 - Shh, Shh, Shh.<br>
  I thought that was you.<br>
  Oh my God, I haven't
 seen you in forever.<br>
  We can't see Darlene right now.<br>
  It's too risky.<br>
  I know you're confused, Elliot.<br>
  But I'm gonna show you.<br>
 I'm gonna show you
  exactly where I've been
 this whole time.<br>
  Look, calm down,
 I'll figure this out.<br>
  I know you don't trust me,
 I wouldn't either,
  but I'm telling you, I'm
 remembering more and more now
  as time goes on.<br>
 That's a plus.<br>
  It's all starting to come back.<br>
  And once we get all the answers,
 I'll be back to normal.<br>
  Except for the fact
 that my dead father
  isn't really dead and is
 sitting across from me.<br>
  I'm gonna step outside and give
 you guys a moment to yourselves.<br>
  We'll try feeding him
 again later, okay?
  Okay.<br>
  We're not
 letting anybody through.<br>
  I I know
 the owner.<br>
  Freddie, are you okay? ls everyone okay?
 What the hell happened?
  I'm still trying to figure
 that one out myself.<br>
  I was gone one day upstate.<br>
  They're saying it was
 electrical, but, who knows?
  On hold with the insurance.<br>
  Cocksuckers are doing
 their typical dance.<br>
  Yeah, I was on hold.<br>
  No, wait.<br> Not again.<br>
  I just came by
 to pick up some drives
  one of my employees
 dropped off yesterday.<br>
  I'm sorry you wasted the trip.<br>
  Everything's gone.<br>
  Tyrell.<br>
  What was it? Boy?
  Yeah.<br>
  Good.<br>
  Thank you for the flowers, sir.<br>
  If I'm being honest, uh, it was
 Anwar who sent the flowers.<br>
  He has a way
 with them.<br>
  Tyrell,
  you don't know me
 to beat around the bush,
  so I'll, I'll get right to it.<br>
  Uh, have a seat.<br>
  You understand the, uh,
  delicate state
 we're in these days.<br>
  I'm sure you're aware,
 this This situation
  with Sharon Knowles is
  It's horrific.<br>
  Scott is understandably
 devastated by it.<br>
  My heart goes out to him.<br>
  But I don't
 know what I'd do if
  Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br>
 I know.<br> I know.<br>
  But the thing is, the
  The police have indicated
 to Scott and to me
  that you are a person
 of interest.<br>
  Yeah, their suspicions are
  Are based on information
 Scott gave them
  about advances
 you made on Sharon.<br>
  Look, Tyrell,
  it was not lost on me
 that you and Scott
  had your own
 competitive frictions.<br>
  Hell, the man nabbed CTO
 right out from under you.<br>
  I'm sure his distress
 is just causing him
  to lash out and you're
 an easy target for him.<br>
  And, of, of course I doubt
 your involvement in this
  This mishap, but, but, but
  The problem remains.<br>
  Scott will continue here,
  but you, I'm afraid, cannot.<br>
  I'm not sure what
 you're saying, Phillip.<br>
  You know exactly
 what I'm saying.<br>
  Phillip, you can't do this.<br>
  You can't do this.<br>
  You can't!
  I've killed myself
 for this company!
  I've been promoted
 faster than anyone else!
  You know, I can't deny I tried
 picturing your reaction.<br>
  I seldom have time
 for such imaginings.<br>
  But, for you, I was curious,
  and it It could have
 gone any number of ways.<br>
  And I found all the different
 versions quite interesting, I admit.<br>
  But, now,
  confronted with the reality,
  I have to say, I'm disappointed.<br>
  Phillip,
  please don't do this.<br>
  I was on a track.<br>
  There was a moment, Tyrell.<br>
  A point in
 your recent past, a
  A mistake, a compulsion,
 a decision, something
  that led you to this
 point right now.<br>
  My only advice to you
 is find that moment
  Understand it.<br>
  It's the only way to reconcile
 this, this failure with yourself.<br>
  Please, sir.<br>
  Don't do this.<br>
  I'm begging you.<br>
  I
  I love this company.<br>
  Mr.<br> Wellick,
 you can't keep ignoring us.<br>
  If you have any
 questions, contact my lawyer.<br>
  If you have evidence
 against me, charge me.<br>
  I know I brought
 you back to township,
  but stopping by our old house
 is not part of the plan.<br>
  Come on, these people
 are gonna be home soon.<br>
  Not the best time for a B and E.<br>
  This is where it
 happened, isn't it?
  What?
 Where what happened?
  You remember anything
 about that window?
  Come on, Elliot.<br>
  Like I said, we should go.<br>
  Elliot, what are you doing?
 Calm down
  You pushed me out this window.<br>
 - Elliot.<br>
  You pushed me off the boardwalk.<br>
  Elliot, come on.<br>
 - No.<br>
  Maybe you're the one
 who needs some pushing now.<br>
  Calm down.<br>
 It was an accident.<br>
  Bullshit!
 I was eight years old!
  - No.<br>
 And you thought I deserved it!
  That's what you said, isn't it?
 - No.<br> No.<br>
  No! No.<br> Right before
 you pushed me again!
  No, Elliot.<br> You thought
 you deserved it.<br>
  You've felt guilty
 about this your whole life.<br>
  About telling people my secret.<br>
  This anger was never at me.<br>
  It was at you!
  Please, Elliot.<br>
  You don't have to be angry
 at yourself anymore.<br>
  Just let it go.<br>
  Please.<br>
 Let it go.<br>
  You're right.<br>
  I was angry.<br>
 I was angry at myself.<br>
  I hated myself for doing
 what I did to you.<br>
  I'm ready to let go.<br>
  What?
  Gonna work in the
 garden a little.<br>
  It'd be nice if you
 wanted to help.<br>
  Oh, by the way, you didn't tell
 me Darlene was back in town.<br>
  I haven't seen her
 back here in a while.<br>
  What did you say?
  Darlene.<br>
  At least I think it was her.<br>
  You saw her?
 Where?
  I'm telling you I did not get
 notification of the request.<br>
  That server needs to remain
 a honeypot off the network.<br>
  Sir, I have the request
 right here from yesterday.<br>
  I'm trying to tell you, Jim, our
 network was compromised yesterday.<br>
  I did not make the request,
 someone else obviously did.<br>
  So you need to take the server off the
 network or something's gonna happen.<br>
  I just can't do that, sir.<br>
  We have specific orders from Tyrell
 Wellick to keep the request as is.<br>
  That doesn't make any sense.<br>
  Look, I need to speak
 to your supervisor.<br>
  Hello?
  Is anyone here?
  Hello?
  Jesus.<br>
  I ran out of places to look, so I figured
 I'd try the last place he'd ever be.<br>
  But struck out again.<br>
  God
  I haven't been here in years.<br>
  The new family that just
 moved in is so weird.<br>
  Especially the dad.<br>
  They didn't really change much.<br>
  You okay?
  Yeah.<br>
  Shit! Weird,
 new dad's back.<br>
  I'm sorry, by the way.<br>
  For what?
  I should be more open with you.<br>
  You're family.<br>
  Okay, okay, don't get
 all mushy on me now.<br>
  Do you see that?
  Wasn't that Elliot's room?
  We're almost there
  Almost there.<br>
  Why Why are we here?
  I thought you said we were
 going somewhere safe.<br>
  Elliot!
  Elliot!
  Shit.<br>
  What the hell
 are they doing here?
  It won't be long now.<br>
  I tried to protect you, son,
 but they caught up to us.<br>
  Elliot!
  What are you talking about?
  That's Darlene and Angela.<br>
  Trust me, son, I wanted
 to tell you sooner.<br>
  Things got too accelerated
 at the end there.<br>
  You have to believe that.<br>
  No matter what anyone tries to
 do, I will never leave you.<br>
  I will always be right here.<br>
  Do you understand that? They are
 not gonna break us apart again.<br>
  What's going on? Tell me right now!
 Listen to me.<br>
  Listen to me, because we
 don't have much time.<br>
  They're gonna try
 and get rid of me again,
  and I need you to not let them.<br>
  Why would they get rid of you?
  Please, Elliot.<br>
 Listen to me.<br>
  I will never leave you.<br>
  I will never leave
 you alone again.<br>
  I love you, son.<br>
  What's he talking about?
  What's he talk
 What's he talking about?
  Hey, I wanna know.<br>
  I wanna know.<br>
  I wanna know!
  Elliot, who are you talking to?
  What do you mean?
 I'm talking to
  Stay back.<br>
 Stay back.<br>
  Elliot, you're bleeding.<br>
  Elliot.<br>
  Ah!
  Elliot, what are you doing here?
  You didn't see him?
  Who?
  - This can't be happening.<br>
 - No.<br>
  This can't be happening.<br>
 This can't be happening.<br>
  No.<br>
  This is happening, isn't it?
  You knew all along, didn't you?
  Huh?
  Elliot,
  who do you think
 you've been talking to?
  You're gonna make
 me say it, aren't you?
  I'm Mr.<br> Robot.<br>
  You're gonna be okay.<br>
  I think I'm pretty
 fucking far from okay.<br>
  Don't take this the wrong way,
  but I envy you.<br>
  I wish I could talk
 to my mom again.<br>
  Even if she isn't real.<br>
  Take care of yourself, okay?
  I know you don't feel
 like talking about it.<br>
  You're right, I don't.<br>
  Unfortunately,
 I need to know, Elliot.<br>
  Given what we've been doing
  I just need to know.<br>
  Do you remember any of it?
  Remember what?
  When we first started fsociety?
  Uh, is Mr.<br> Wellick in?
  Oh, hi, Mr.<br> Goddard.<br>
  No, he's gone.<br>
  He was, um
 He was let go today.<br>
  What?
  Uh, why?
  I don't know.<br>
  He wasn't always the easiest
 person to deal with.<br>
  I'm
 I'm sure.<br>
  Uh
  Do you think you can get me
 in to see, uh, Scott Knowles?
  It's urgent.<br>
  Oh, no.<br>
  Definitely not now.<br>
  You haven't heard?
  Dad, what's going on?
  I'll let you two talk.<br>
  I know, I know, but, hey,
  you popped in over at my home.<br>
  I figured I'd, uh,
 return the favor.<br>
  What do you want?
  To offer you something
 you may want.<br>
  Come on in.<br>
  If this is about the case
  Please.<br> I don't care
 about the case.<br>
  I don't even understand the case.<br>
 I have lawyers for that.<br>
  Then what?
  You boys can wait outside.<br>
  So, I gotta be honest,
  I was impressed by you.<br>
  Sure, your career's finished, but
 you played a great short game.<br>
  You took a big gamble
 and you got what you wanted.<br>
  It was just, you know,
 the wrong thing to want.<br>
  What do you care?
  You know, I looked into
 you over there at Allsafe.<br>
  I mean, lots of people would have
 settled into middle-management bliss
  after all the shit you've taken.<br>
 But you didn't.<br>
  You're relentless and smart.<br>
  And that combination
 is very valuable
  to a lot of important people.<br>
 People I know.<br>
  Where are you going
 with all of this?
  I think I can land you
 a pretty lucrative gig.<br>
  A gig?
  Where?
  Your favorite place, where else?
  You slummed it
  all the way down
 to Jersey in person
  to offer me a job at the company
  I'm currently suing?
  What's the real ask here?
  I think you'd make
 a great businesswoman.<br>
  I'm afraid it's nothing
 more than that.<br>
  Is this a joke?
  It's no joke.<br> My pals think you
 can bring a lot to the table.<br>
  You can't be offering
 me a job there.<br>
  You're testifying against them.<br>
  So? You'll find this out
 fairly soon,
  but, in business, grudges
 aren't really a thing.<br>
  It's too emotional.<br>
  It's because you pulled off, what you
 pulled off, that they called me.<br>
  This is a huge
 class-action lawsuit.<br>
  They're going to pay millions.<br>
  Roughly 75 to 100 million.<br>
  And that's what their
 lawyers will settle for.<br>
  After they exhaust most of your legal
 team's funds for the next seven years.<br>
  And, sure, that is That's a lot of
 money, but not to them, not really.<br>
  We started a rainy-day fund when the
 leak happened just for this occasion.<br>
  The fund itself has already
 made five times that amount.<br>
  I'd like to ask you to leave.<br>
  Shall I pass your name
 along to them?
  I'm not working there.<br>
  They killed my mother.<br>
  And every fast food joint
 around the corner
  delivers diabetes
 to millions of people.<br>
  Phillip Morris hands out lung
 cancer on the hour, every hour.<br>
  I mean, hell,
  everyone's destroying the planet
 beyond the point of no return.<br>
  Are you really gonna start taking
 all of these things so personally?
  Maybe I will.<br>
  Maybe someone has to.<br>
  A suggestion.<br>
  If you want to change things,
  perhaps you should
 try from Within.<br>
  Because this is what
 happens from the outside.<br>
  These guys don't wait on anyone.<br>
  So you'll have to let
 'em know by tomorrow.<br>
  I'll show myself out.<br>
  These are all empty.<br>
  Are you just filling them
 and dumping them?
  Where are your new 'scrips?
  What does it matter?
  I don't even know
 what's real anymore.<br>
  Look
  I know you feel
 shitty right now.<br>
  But once you take your meds
  Maybe we should
 stop it, Darlene.<br>
  Stop what?
  The plan.<br>
  The hack.<br>
  Everything.<br> Maybe we
 shouldn't execute it.<br>
  What?
 Why?
  The minute our infected server gets
 back on the main network, we're set.<br>
  It wasn't me.<br>
  The whole time.<br>
  Wasn't really me
 doing all of that.<br>
  Elliot.<br>
  The reasons we
 wanted to do this,
  the reasons why we all
 wanted to do this, are real.<br>
  Maybe you don't realize this,
 but this was your idea.<br>
  You came up with this.<br>
  There is a part of you,
 somewhere deep down inside,
  that knows this is the
 right thing to do.<br>
  I'm gonna get your meds.<br>
  We'll talk more
 when I get back, okay?
  Come on.<br>
  What would you do
 if you were in my shoes?
  I know, I know,
 I'm officially crazy
  but the plan isn't.<br>
  Is it?
  What the hell are you
  Shh! Shh.<br>
  I've been waiting outside your
 apartment until she left.<br>
  I didn't want anyone
 to know I'm here.<br>
  I know you're behind it.<br>
  All of it.<br>
  Fsociety.<br>
  The server.<br> Colby.<br> Allsafe.<br>
  You're the one constant
 in a sea of variables.<br>
  Elliot?
  Now,
  I don't know what
 you're grand plan is,
  but I need to, and
 you're going to tell me.<br>
  Two days ago, I strangled
 a woman to death.<br>
  Just with my hands.<br>
  It's a strange sensation.<br>
  Something so tremendous done by
  something so simple.<br>
  The first 10 seconds were
  Uncomfortable.<br>
  A feeling of limbo.<br>
  But then your muscles tense.<br>
  And she struggles and fights,
  but it almost disappears
 in the background
  along with everything else
 in the world.<br>
  In that moment, it's just
 you and absolute power.<br>
  Nothing else.<br>
  That moment stayed with me.<br>
  I thought I'd feel guilty
 for being a murderer.<br>
  But I don't.<br>
  I feel wonder.<br>
  How long has this been going on?
  I don't know.<br>
  And what is it that
 you're doing, exactly?
  Encrypting all the files.<br>
  All of Evil Corp's
 financial records
  will be impossible to access.<br>
  The encryption key
 will self-delete
  after the process completes.<br>
  - What about the backups?
 - I took care of that, too.<br>
  China and
 Steel Mountain.<br>
  Of course, even when
 we went redundant
  I hacked the AirDream network.<br>
  I was in all of them.<br>
  You really thought
 of everything.<br>
  Who else was involved?
  Just me.<br>
  Well, now it's you and me.<br>
  I've always told you we'd end
 up working together, Elliot.<br>
  But Still,
  I have to know.<br>
  Why did you do it?
  What did you hope to accomplish
 by doing all of this?
  I don't know.<br>
  I wanted to save the world.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
