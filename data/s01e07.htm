 So? What do we got?
  Terry Colby
 was involved in the cover-up
  of the Washington Township
 toxic waste scandal
  What do we need
 to prove our case?
  Someone who was there
 when the decision was made
  to falsify chemical waste intel.<br>
  Get the hell away from my
 home, get away from my home!
  Elliot, what is
 going on with you?
  I cannot help you if you
 keep me in the dark.<br>
  We got problems.<br>
  The Dark Army is bailing.<br>
  It's not over.<br>
  We'll find a way.<br>
 Just not tonight.<br>
  How do you not blow your
 brains out married to him?
  You wanna watch me piss, too?
  Scott,
 a misunderstanding.<br>
  Happy to pull my
 dick out for you.<br>
  Elliot.<br>
  Where is she?
  Told you you'd
 get her back, bro.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
  Shit.<br>
  Shit!
  Open up!
  I'm bleeding all
 over the hallway.<br>
  It's a life or death
 situation out here.<br>
  Look, I know you're in there.<br>
 I just saw you go in.<br>
  Open up.<br>
  I'm lo
  Well, are you just
 gonna stand there?
  Get me a glass of water, dummy.<br>
  Can I use this? Thanks.<br>
  My niece gave him to me.<br>
  I haven't even named him yet.<br>
  God.<br> Do you know the pressure
 of an ecstatic six-year-old?
  I mean, I kill that thing
 and her whole world
  collapses.<br>
  I like what you did
 with the place.<br>
  Hmm.<br> Yeah, nice setup.<br>
  I still like mine
 better, though.<br>
  Yeah, let me know if you
 want a top-shelf hook-up.<br>
  Actually, now that I have you,
  will you help me move a dresser,
  Mr.<br> Muscles?
  Okay, come on.<br>
 Just come on.<br>
  Man 'N' Van is
 getting way too legit.<br>
  It used to just be like drummers
  with their moms' Honda Odysseys.<br>
  Now it's an actual
 company in Queens.<br>
  I mean, the guys
  are literally men in vans.<br>
  I'd buy morphine from you
  If you could also
 get me Suboxone.<br>
  Pictures of you,
 that I almost believe that.<br>
  Well, um, it's pretty much
  impossible to get Suboxone.<br>
  My supplier doesn't have it.<br>
  I saw this song live once.<br>
 It was so rad.<br>
  Don't you just love hearing
 your favorite songs in person,
  like half-deaf
 from the speakers,
  everyone going nuts around you?
  No.<br>
  Direct.<br>
 I respect that.<br>
  I just hate concerts.<br>
  Lots of people.<br>
  and I ran to your
 heart to be near
  You don't like people, huh?
  Not most of them, no.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  Well, so, by that rationale,
  if you were to really
 like one person,
  it would be, like,
 considered an aberration, or
  an abnormality or
  Special, even.<br>
  I guess.<br>
  Well, I aim for special,
  so challenge accepted.<br>
  all your courage,
 to let it all go
  I wish we already
 knew each other.<br>
  Would make this
 feel less awkward.<br>
  You really feel
 awkward right now?
  Yeah.<br>
  Well, then, I wish we
 knew each other too then.<br>
  Remembering, you fallen
 into my arms
  Oh, yikes.<br>
 I'm, um, I'm late.<br>
  Meeting the girls for drinks.<br>
  Oh, um, I'm Shayla.<br>
  Elliot.<br>
  You were always
 so lost in the dark
  You know, I do know of a
 guy who sells Suboxone.<br>
  He's supposed to be
 a fucking psychopath,
  but if you want I can call him.<br>
  You might be worth a psychopath.<br>
  I don't know.<br>
 Maybe.<br>
  Oh, and, keep the fish,
 you filthy animal.<br>
  Slip away quietly
  Open my eyes
  But I never see anything
  If only I'd thought
 of the right words
  I could have held on
 to your heart
  Sorry I haven't
 talked to you in a while.<br>
  I mean, it's only been a month,
  which I guess in the grand scheme
 of things isn't that long.<br>
  Isn't our life like a blip in the
 cosmic calendar or something?
  So, that's Shayla.<br>
  A blip.<br> Not even.<br>
  Here one blip, gone the next.<br>
  Makes me hate myself that
 I've already gotten used
  to the idea of
 her not being here.<br>
  In a year, I'll maybe think about
 her every once in a while.<br>
  Then, she'll become an anecdote.<br>
  A thing to say.<br>
 "I knew a girl that died.<br>"
  With the added bonus of,
 "She died because of me.<br>"
  Maybe I should hate myself.<br>
  Here are the last two forms.<br>
  She's getting rid of me
  in case you're still
 trying to figure that out.<br>
  - Once I
 - Sign on the bottom.<br>
  Then I'll deliver it
 to the court.<br>
  And in two weeks' time, you'll receive
 an official release from the mandate.<br>
  That second form means
  that we've been sitting
 in this room for a year.<br>
  Over 52 hours of Krista's voice
 bouncing around this room.<br>
  She thinks she's a wasted echo.<br>
  Maybe she is.<br>
  I wonder how much time I've spent
 not listening to her in here.<br>
  I'm worried about you, Elliot.<br> I
 really want you to keep coming here.<br>
  We've got a lot more work to do.<br>
  She wants more from me,
 but she doesn't believe in me.<br>
  I tried because I believe
 some part inside of you
  wants to do this right.<br>
  You? Are you on her side?
  You should clean your sockets.<br>
  Sounds too good to be
 true, but I'll bite.<br>
  What's the ask?
  Given my client has information
 that could help your client's case,
  we want the meeting restricted
 to her, Colby, and myself.<br>
  And we want it
 conducted off-record.<br>
  Antara, come on.<br>
  My client won't
 accept your presence.<br>
  Our client pays for ours.<br>
  Then you're duty-bound
 to present him
  with any legitimate offer
 of beneficial evidence.<br>
  Of course.<br>
  Give us something truly
 legitimate and beneficial.<br>
  You won't even tell us what
 the hell your client has.<br>
  Seth, we've been sitting on opposite
 sides of the negotiating table
  for two decades.<br>
  I'm not some joker,
 come out of the woodwork,
  trying to scam
 Colby for millions.<br>
  I'm giving him the only
 glimmer of hope he's had.<br>
  We'll pass along your offer.<br>
 Thanks for your time.<br>
  Lloyd said you wanted to see me.<br>
  Uh
  Look, I appreciate your
 commitment to this job.<br>
  I really do.<br>
  But I don't see how
 you've plowed through
  these last few weeks.<br> So
  I want to offer you
 some time off.<br>
  Just some time to I don't
 need time off.<br> I'm good.<br>
  Uh, one more thing.<br>
  Look
  I'm so sorry she was
 taken away, Elliot,
  but don't let her death
 close you off entirely.<br>
  Find someone you can be
 your honest self with.<br>
  Okay?
  I remember when I was
 a kid, I got into web design
  by ripping off sites I liked.<br>
  All you had to do was
 "view source" on your browser
  and there it was, the code.<br>
  You could copy-paste it,
  modify it a little,
  put your name on it, and
 like that, it was your site.<br>
  View source.<br>
  What if we had that for people?
  Would people really wanna see?
  Find someone to be
 your honest self with?
  Bullshit.<br>
  Really good advice.<br> Thanks.<br>
  I quote,
 "The US contingent
  "of the hacker group,
 fsociety, has remained quiet
  "since the upheaval inflicted upon the
 world's largest multinational conglomerate.<br>
  "Secretary of Homeland
 Security Jeh Johnson
  "released a statement
 today stating that
  "These groups lack the resources
 and knowledge of the US cell
  "to successfully
 mount an attack.<br>"
  End quote.<br>
  Yeah, so?
  You gotta get
 the Dark Army back.<br>
  Dude, I've been trying.<br>
  How many times
 do you want me to hack him?
  Do you know how hard
 hacking a hacker is?
  Cisco switches OSs
 like all the time
  Darlene, we need one meeting.<br>
  Yeah, well, I've been
 using Cisco's handle
  to send requests
 for the past month.<br>
  I got nothing.<br>
  He's slower than me,
 but not by much.<br>
  If we can talk
 to Whiterose directly
  Whiterose?
 Whiterose? Really?
  Okay, if
 If the guy even exists,
  and that's a big if,
  no way he's meeting
 you face-to-face.<br>
  For all we know,
 this dude's Whiterose.<br>
  Excuse me?
  Are you Whiterose?
  A likely story.<br>
  Besides, the tape backups
  already shipped to all the new
 Steel Mountain facilities,
  and we still haven't
 found a way around that.<br>
  I got
 a plan in motion.<br>
  And God's laughing.<br>
  This is all
 I have left of her.<br>
  I will miss her.<br>
  I need to wipe again.<br>
  So, if you scroll
 to the next page,
  you'll see the summary of capital
 budgets for purchasing and operations.<br>
  We get it, the goddamn earning reports
 are gonna look good come Monday.<br>
  Our aim is to
 facilitate bill payment
  and heighten financial security.<br>
  So, that's an extra 2%.<br>
  You know, if we hadn't turned our
 profits around, I was gonna leave.<br>
  No way.<br>
  Where? Don't tell me Apple.<br>
  Google.<br>
  Don't buy it.<br>
  I got a blowjob from
 the hiring executive
  on the Googleplex
 volleyball court.<br>
  Oh, she was hot,
  had a Marissa Mayer
 thing going on too.<br>
  Hot execs started
 as hot assistants
  who fucked their way to the top
  twice as fast as the rest of us.<br>
  You know something
 screwed up?
  I heard that some assistants,
 they're going gay to
  move up the ladder.<br>
  I'll do you one better.<br>
  There's a
 special handful
  of pathetically
 desperate execs going cock jockey.<br>
  - No.<br> Oh, my God.<br>
 Mmm-hmm.<br>
  Hey, Dwight, I meant to ask,
  how are your children?
  Hell if I know.<br> Sent 'em
 off to, uh, Lawrence.<br>
  I think Julia likes art.<br>
  Oh, well, can't win 'em all.<br>
  Lawrence?
  You'll never be able to afford
 that tuition on unemployment.<br>
  - Sorry?
 - You're fired!
  You two, as well.<br>
  I'm making sure you all receive
 the minimum severance packages.<br>
  Mr.<br> Wellick,
 uh, I don't understand.<br>
  What did we do?
  Nothing.<br>
  - And I've took - You said
 you would update me.<br>
  I needed to discuss our situation
 with the state's attorney.<br>
  Thanks for coming in, Roy.<br>
  Yeah.<br>
  I think you should have a seat.<br>
  Colby's lawyers
 called 30 minutes ago.<br>
  They wanted a promise
 of total immunity
  before the meeting, which I
 obtained from the man you just met.<br>
  So, yes, Colby agreed.<br>
  With a caveat.<br>
  I can't be in the room.<br>
 You have to go in alone.<br>
  Look, you made a ballsy move.<br>
  But you doing what
 you're about to do
  Entering the home of
 a very powerful man
  with a lot at stake and
 asking him for something,
  that's always
 a dangerous proposition.<br>
  So, one last time
  Are you sure you wanna do this?
  Aw, shit, man.<br>
  I thought you was
 one of them high schoolers
  stole my mom's chaise lounge.<br>
  As heartbreaking as
 it is to hear that,
  you're gonna have
 to put that off.<br>
  We're getting everybody
 back together.<br> Come on.<br>
  Aw, man.<br> Not this time.<br> I'm out.<br>
  You can't be out.<br>
 We need you.<br>
  Look, man, I got a new set of
 people depending on me, okay?
  Clients out the wazoo,
 so, you know
  I mean good luck.<br> And
 tell the kids I said hi.<br>
  What is this? What
 are you doing here?
  Well, I figured out
 how to insert THC's
  genetic information
 code into yeast cells.<br>
  Tripled my earning speed.<br>
  Plants need weeks to develop.<br>
 Microbes need days.<br>
  So, what, you got
 a Bath & Body Works
  bottling facility
 in your backyard?
  Try it.<br>
  The THC level is
 borderline in that blend,
  and the lavender
 doesn't mess with the high.<br>
  You just smooth it on your skin.<br>
  So, you're rejecting
 a revolution
  in favor of aroma profiles?
  What a waste of potential.<br>
  - Look, man, I
 know I got a good brain.<br>
  Besides
  What was our little project
 in the end, anyway?
  Wasted shit if you ask me.<br>
  Ah, now you're
 borderline pissing me off.<br>
  Is that a fact?
  And what exactly
 are you gonna do
  if I decide to
 cross that border?
  Look at my face, Romero.<br>
  You and I both know I'm crazy.<br>
  Not the cute kind, either.<br>
 I'm talking
  Crazy, crazy!
  You lost touch.<br>
  You forgot the feeling of
 spilling blood on the battlefield
  but winning the fight.<br>
  I didn't wanna hurt you, Romero.<br>
  I love you, man.<br>
  I just wanted you to come
 back to the arcade with me
  so we could change
 the world together.<br>
  I am clearly too crazy
 for you to say no to.<br>
  Bam!
  The look on your
 face, priceless.<br>
  Goddamn lunatic.<br>
  You gave me your word when we started
 this thing that you'd finish it.<br>
  I gave you my word what
 I'd do if you didn't.<br>
  See you back at the arcade.<br>
  Good, I see
 the girl got you tea.<br>
  Well, let's get started.<br>
  How much do you want?
  Write your number.<br>
  You can ask me
 anything you want,
  but I promise you,
 at the end of the day,
  money will always be better
 than what you're looking for.<br>
  Mr.<br> Colby
  Did you attend the executive
 board meetings during 1993?
  Were you in the room
  when the decision was made
 to ignore the treatment
  of hazardous waste
 in Washington Township?
  I have information
 which can help you,
  if you answer my question.<br>
  I don't know what
 you're talking about.<br>
  If you agree to testify
 against the executives
  who covered up the illegal
  dumping of epoxy resin waste,
  I will testify that
  I broke chain of custody
  with the .<br>DAT file
  central to your case.<br>
  You're that hot little thing
 that came by here a month ago.<br>
  The girl from Allsafe.<br>
  I remember.<br> Yeah.<br>
  Okay
  I'm gonna answer your question.<br>
  But here's what
 I need from you first.<br>
  So, I'm gonna
 pull down my pants.<br>
  And then, I'm gonna need you to
 take that pouty mouth of yours
  and swallow up my balls.<br>
  Now
  They're big and hairy,
 especially the left one,
  so you're really gonna have to,
  I don't know, squish 'em up
 to get 'em inside there.<br>
  You're probably gonna have
 to do one cheek at a time.<br>
  But then, once they're all
 warm and snug in there,
  I want you to repeat
 your question to me
  as clearly as you can.<br>
  Then, and only then,
  am I willing to answer.<br>
  What do you say?
  If you don't take this deal,
  you'll become like me.<br>
  Sure, maybe you'll
 live in this house.<br>
  Maybe you'll have money.<br>
  But even if your
 expensive lawyers
  find a way to get you off,
  people will still think
 that you're guilty.<br>
  Losing everyone's respect
  The respect of people you know
  and the people you don't,
  it's a shitty feeling
  Trust me.<br>
  I'll have the girl let me out.<br>
  Flipper.<br>
  Is she microchipped?
  Okay.<br>
  Very good.<br>
  Housekeeping done.<br>
  Now, on to the real business.<br>
  Has your dog ever
 eaten trash before?
  No.<br>
  I mean, not
 Not that I remember.<br>
  Well, lucky for
 your bank account,
  the piece is small
 enough to pass on its own.<br>
  Unfortunately, though,
 it's large enough
  to send her puking
 all over your apartment.<br>
  So, I would crate her
 for a few days
  and monitor her.<br>
  She won't know what you're
 doing is good for her.<br>
  You were right.<br>
  I was only trying to prove
  Colby's lawyers just
 called.<br> He wants to talk.<br>
  Get back there.<br>
  It's a little early in the
 morning to be nerding out,
  don't you think?
  How long?
  - I knew if I asked you, they'd
 - How long?
  A couple weeks.<br>
  And you had the balls to ask
 for Whiterose, with my shit.<br>
  It's like you wanna
 get us both killed.<br>
  What happened?
 He responded?
  You know
  You didn't have to make me look
 like a shitty foot soldier.<br>
  Nobody would ever
 even know that
  You got rid of my box
 and found the IP.<br>
  Then you joined their
 channel with my handle.<br>
  We're so done.<br>
  I don't wanna see you again.<br>
  But you fools
 actually got your wish.<br>
  I don't know why, but the
 meeting's actually gonna be on.<br>
  I'd tell you to be careful,
  but I know that's the last
 thing you're gonna be.<br>
  My lawyers are looking
 over the paperwork.<br>
  - Does that mean that
 - Exactly what I said.<br>
  I asked you back here to make sure
 that you can pull off your testimony.<br>
  To make sure that this chain of
 custody story of yours is straight.<br>
  I can't afford any trips.<br>
  I'm not going to trip.<br>
  So what
  What's in this for you, anyway?
  I know you hate me.<br>
  So, what, you're gonna just
 let me off scot-free?
  What do you get out of this?
  Earlier, I asked you a question.<br>
  You never answered it.<br>
  If I'm agreeing to testify
 in your case, then,
  yes, you know,
 I attended several meetings.<br>
  Tell me about the one when they
  decided to ignore the leak.<br>
  I'm I'm not sure
 what you're asking.<br>
  What was the meeting like
 when you decided this?
  I get it.<br>
  You wanna know, like,
 what was it like?
  Like, um, did we all have cigars
  and laugh hysterically as we
 signed the evil documents?
  Is that what you pictured?
  Well, I'm sorry, hon, you see, the
 world doesn't work like that.<br>
  Tell me.<br>
 Tell me how it works.<br>
  Uh, Jesus, um, all right.<br>
  All right.<br>
 Let's see.<br>
  January, '93
  Well, my secretary
 then was Elaine.<br>
  So, Elaine brought us
 a platter of shrimp cocktail
  to tide us to dinner,
 which pissed us off.<br>
  Because we just had a platter
 at the holiday party.<br>
  Jim opened the bar.<br>
  Now Jim was
 a real piece of work.<br>
  I mean half-pansy,
 half-mafia.<br>
  First sign of a tight decision,
  he'd be chain-smoking,
 down a river of scotch.<br>
  Uh
  You know, it rained.<br>
  It rained.<br>
 I remember that.<br>
  Yeah.<br>
  So
  You were drunk,
  eating shrimp cocktail,
  and it was raining when you
 decided my mother would die?
  That's why.<br>
  So, people like you won't keep
 sitting in rooms together.<br>
  Did any of it ever give
 you or anyone pause,
  when you made those decisions?
  Yeah.<br>
  Yeah.<br>
  Sure.<br>
  But, um
  But then you go home.<br>
 And, uh
  And you have dinner,
 you know.<br> And
  And you wake up
 the next morning.<br>
  Here's to a man who has
 a bright future at our company.<br>
  A man you all know.<br>
  A man who's gonna change
 this company for the good.<br>
  A man smart enough to marry a
 woman every bit his equal.<br>
  Our new
 Chief Technology Officer,
  Scott Knowles.<br>
  Thank you.<br>
  Thank you.<br>
 Thank you, Phillip.<br>
  Welcome.<br> Here we go.<br> Thank you.<br>
  - It's great to be here.<br>
 - And we're off.<br> We're off.<br>
  - Thanks, Phillip.<br>
 - You're very welcome.<br>
  - Congratulations.<br>
 - Congratulations.<br>
  Yeah.<br>
 Come and say hello.<br>
  - Congratulations, Scott.<br>
 - Joseph.<br> How are you?
  Thank you.<br>
  Tyrell.<br> Nice to see you.<br>
  Is it?
  I hear you shared our
 moment with your husband.<br>
  Oh, come on, that was
 over a month ago.<br>
  Don't tell me you're still sore.<br>
  Hmm, I sense some defeat.<br>
  Well, I consider myself, at
 the very least, reprimanded.<br>
  How disappointing.<br>
  One tiny curveball
 and you gave up.<br>
  Miss?
  Thank you.<br>
  I should have known that you were
 nothing more than a bold entrance.<br>
  Are you saying you don't
 crave a bold entrance?
  Every time?
 Over and over.<br>
  Sustained.<br>
  Meet me tonight.<br>
  I'm a little busy.<br>
  Come to my office, now.<br>
  Are you really asking me that?
  I don't recall phrasing
 it as a question, no.<br>
  Fine, then I just won't show up.<br>
  Then the roof.<br>
  Take the back stairwell.<br>
  The cameras have
 been out since March.<br>
  No one will know.<br>
  Well, you just made
 a long day longer.<br>
  I know that Allsafe
 will have to fire me.<br>
  But testifying was
 the right thing to do.<br>
  I have worked my ass off
 to take care of you.<br>
  And of every person
 in this company.<br>
  Do you know what that means?
  You've been
 a great boss, Gideon.<br>
  Once this confession
 goes public,
  no one will want to
 do business with us.<br>
  The company will go under.<br>
  I couldn't let Colby take the
 fall for something that I did.<br>
  Oh, come on.<br> You and I both know
 you didn't break chain of custody.<br>
  I did, and I feel terrible
  Angela! Please.<br>
  Stop lying.<br>
  You do this,
  all these people go down.<br>
  All their families
  that rely on what this
 company provides for them.<br>
  So, this is where
 the rabbit hole leads?
  Gotta be honest, I half-expected
 you not to show up.<br>
  And I half-expected
 you to be a tattle-tale.<br>
  So you are sore.<br>
  Oh, come on, you intrigued me,
  I intrigued back.<br>
  Can't we just be
 more straightforward?
  Well, that's no fun,
 but if you insist
  I just came up here to see if you
 were really as gullible as you seem.<br>
  My husband's downstairs
 getting the job that you want,
  and you're up here
 trying fuck to me.<br>
  Now, whether that's you
  being straightforward or a game,
  either way, it's played
 pretty poorly, if you ask me.<br>
  Hmm.<br> Again,
 I asked no question.<br>
  All I can tell you is,
 you need this.<br>
  'Cause you're dissatisfied.<br>
  Scott
 plans on firing you
  and you are clinging on
 to any chance you can get.<br>
  You seem desperate.<br>
  I know it hurts
  You know
  I'd quench that thirst
  I can treat you
 You say you're lonely
  I say you'll think about it Hey.<br>
  Hey, what are you
 Get off me!
  'Cause you're the only
  Stop!
  One who resonates
  Flying like a screaming falcon
  Only way to do each other
  Pull out the incisor
  Give me two weeks
 you won't recognize her
  Mouth open you're high
  Higher than a motherfucker
  Dreamin' of you as high
  We connected
 with Whiterose.<br>
  The plan is back on.<br>
  I could bullshit you.<br>
  Tell you you're the only person
  who can fill the exact void
 we have at fsociety.<br>
  The truth is, I need this
 group back together.<br>
  Have you ever considered which
 part of our scheme motivates you?
  When the Dark Army bailed,
  you didn't care if pushing the button
 would bring an economic revolution.<br>
  You want momentary anarchy.<br>
  The others?
  Mobley likes palling around.<br>
  Romero wants a whiff of fame.<br>
  Those reasons depress me.<br>
  What's the part you want?
  You don't care.<br>
  My parents were born in Iran.<br>
  They came here
 like everybody else,
  for freedom,
  but my dad works
 60-hour weeks
  to determine tax loopholes
  for a millionaire art dealer.<br>
  My mom, she ran up
 loans into five digits
  to get an online degree.<br>
  They won't shut up about
 how great America is.<br>
  But they're gonna die in debt,
  doing things they
 never wanted to do.<br>
  There are how many billion
 people in this world?
  7.<br>3.<br>
  Somehow you and I
 landed together,
  doing something impossible
 if we were alone.<br>
  Not to mention, at the
 right point in history,
  with the right resources.<br>
  We have what we've worked for,
  right there for the taking.<br>
  We just need each other
 to see this through.<br>
  You come any closer,
 I'm calling the cops.<br>
  Hi, Operator?
  I'd like to report an emergency.<br>
  I placed a malicious
 CD in my work computer,
  and now this guy at the
 gym is saying hi to me.<br>
  I'm going home.<br>
  I need you to do
 something for me.<br>
  Call the girl who wants
 to be involved, okay?
  Her name is Angela Moss.<br>
  - Let me give you her phone number
 - Listen, pussy.<br>
  If you don't do what I say,
  then the giant shit storm
 that rains turds later
  will leave a trail
 of clouds in the sky
  spelling out your name.<br>
  Elliot.<br>
  I wasn't expecting you.<br>
  I'm here for my appointment.<br>
  Well, you can slip in
 before my first patient.<br>
  You told me I should
 tell you the truth.<br>
  Yes.<br>
  Everything I say
 will still be protected?
  And confidential?
  I've been lying to you.<br>
  I don't take my pills.<br>
  But you don't either.<br>
  Your refill frequency for Ativan
  doesn't match your prescription
 divided by the dosage.<br>
  This morning,
  you bought a tall
 hazelnut latte,
  paid for it on
 your Evil Corp card.<br>
  And by text you
 justified the indulgence
  to your sister because Evil
 Corp gives you double rewards.<br>
  But those points only
 accumulate on travel expenses.<br>
  You're not good with money.<br>
  On paper,
  your Thursday 2:00,
 Marilyn O'Brien,
  is your doppelganger.<br>
  I think
  You're encouraging her
 to leave her husband
  because you're tired
 of being dumped.<br>
  You like porn, especially anal.<br>
  Whether you like it
 yourself, I don't know.<br>
  That's not relevant to me.<br>
  You've told your best
 friend, Jennifer, that
  you wish your mom would die.<br>
  I sometimes watch
 you on your webcam.<br>
  You cry sometimes,
  just like me
  because you're lonely.<br>
  I donât just hack you, Krista.<br>
  I hack everyone.<br>
  My friends,
 co-workers.<br>
  But I've helped a lot of people.<br>
  I want
  A way out of loneliness.<br>
  Just like you.<br>
  Is that what you wanted to hear?
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
