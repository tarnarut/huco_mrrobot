 He wants to hack Steel Mountain's
 climate control system,
  raise the facility's heat high
 enough to destroy all the tapes.<br>
  This is what we're doing.<br>
  I'll hit up my Dark Army contact
 as soon as you take off.<br>
  You're just gonna hit up the
 world's most dangerous hacker crew?
  He has my bank account, Ollie.<br>
  We cannot just infect Allsafe's
 network because of this.<br>
  I'll lose my job!
  Evil Corp's upping
 their security protocol.<br>
  They are physically copying, then
 shipping all the analog backups.<br>
  We go up today.<br>
  I want you to be where you
 belong, here with me.<br>
  I think I'm happy where I am.<br>
  Don't let me down,
 okay?
  That girl in there is mine.<br>
  Did you have something
 to do with Vera getting busted?
  He's on murder charges,
 do you know that?
  It's my plan, I'll go in.<br>
  You might be able to hide it from these
 nerds but I know a junkie when I see one.<br>
  I'm alone.<br>
  No you're not.<br>
 I'm not goin' anywhere, kiddo.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
  I wish I had better
 news for you, Fernando,
  but this isn't the
 you're-getting-out meeting.<br>
  This is only as much
 as I could carry.<br>
  The DA has more.<br>
  How long this gonna be?
  We're talking years.<br>
  Yo, are you playin'? You get our
 people out.<br> That's your use to us.<br>
  They have a solid case.<br>
  For every charge they're gonna lay
 on you, they have these binders,
  your Twitters, your Instagram.<br>
  - You said they wouldn't figure this
 They can't, bro.<br>
  I'm tellin' you,
 it was airtight, V.<br>
  Fellas, this isn't
 The Imitation Game.<br>
  The code here is
 not that complicated.<br>
  Besides, who told you to put your
 business anywhere near social media?
  My aspirational little brother.<br>
  You know how much money
 we saved last year?
  Made our whole operation way
 more efficient.<br> We were careful.<br>
  You tweeted about every transaction
 your business was involved in.<br>
  That is the opposite of careful.<br>
  It's no wonder an anonymous
 tip turned you in.<br>
  Who called in the tip?
  This is what is
 meant by anonymous.<br>
  It is now spilled milk.<br>
  The information got out and
 now they're coming down hard.<br>
  There's no plea on the table.<br>
  They're gonna lay
 murder one on you.<br>
  I ain't pleading anyway.<br>
 Men can't sentence me.<br>
  That is a cosmic responsibility.<br>
  Someone's gonna
 get hurt for this.<br>
  That's how we get
 square with the universe.<br>
  Fernando, we need
 to discuss strategy.<br>
  You don't want supermax.<br>
 No, uh
  If they lock me up, the kind
 of door they close don't matter.<br>
  So, that's you.<br>
 That's who you are.<br>
  I know you.<br>
  Mmm-hmm.<br>
  Excuse me.<br> Pardon me.<br>
 Pardon me.<br> I already paid.<br>
  I just wanna pay
 my respects.<br> Thank you.<br>
  Oh, I'm sorry man.<br> I'm sorry.<br>
  I just wanna pay my compliments.<br>
  Hey, excellent coffee.<br>
 Fantastic service.<br>
  Buy yourself something nice.<br>
  Steel Mountain.<br>
  We're trying to penetrate a data security
 facility whose tagline literally is
  Nothing ls
 actually impenetrable.<br>
  A place like this
 says it is, and it's close,
  but people still
 built this place.<br>
  And if you can hack
 the right person,
  all of a sudden you have
 a piece of powerful malware.<br>
  People always make
 the best exploits.<br>
  I've never found it hard
 to hack most people.<br>
  If you listen to them,
 watch them,
  their vulnerabilities are like a
 neon sign screwed into their heads.<br>
  Mobley is a glutton, who lacks
 discipline from his urges.<br>
  I don't want to get bugs.<br>
 They spread disease.<br>
  Romero is a know-it-all.<br>
 And a hypochondriac.<br>
  Bill Harper
 is our first exploit.<br>
  He isn't gonna give the search much
 scrutiny.<br> He can get us to Level One.<br>
  But Bill is not gonna be
 able to get us to Level Two.<br>
  And we need to get to Level Two.<br>
  You're gonna ask to speak
 to his supervisor, Wendy.<br>
  She'll get us to exactly
 where we need to be.<br>
  Then we'll be able to get
 rid of her from the van.<br>
  After that, you'll connect the Raspberry
 Pi to the climate control system
  and Bob's your uncle.<br>
  Now we can hear you,
 and you can hear us.<br>
  Mr.<br> Robot? His flaw is
 he's absolutely insane.<br>
  We're talking clinical.<br>
  When they say, "If your friends
 jump off a bridge, would you?"
  He would, without hesitation.<br>
 Just to prove something.<br>
  He goes in there, he's
 liable to blow the whole place up,
  just like he wanted to
 in the first place.<br>
  Sure you don't wanna look over
 the info and the map again?
  I got it.<br>
 Okay, James Bond.<br>
  Let's go mess this shit up.<br>
 Boom, boom.<br>
  Yes, I also have security flaws.<br>
 I don't like being outside.<br>
  I liked morphine too much.<br>
 Mr.<br> Sepiol?
  I'm talking to you right now
 and you don't exist.<br>
  Sam Sepiol? Sir?
  That's you, Elliot.<br>
  Okay.<br>
 So sorry you had to wait.<br>
  As you can see, there's
 always a lot of bustle here.<br>
  How can I help you today?
  You need a tour.<br>
 Don't elaborate.<br>
  Uh, a tour.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  I'm sure they told you at reception
 that we require appointments for tours.<br>
  My supervisor gives us all
 a hard time about that.<br>
  I'm Sam Sepiol.<br>
  You should look me up.<br>
  Okay  A little
 inelegant, but we can work with it.<br>
  Tell you what, have your company
 call over to new accounts
  and we can set something up later
 this week.<br> Ask for Bill Harper.<br>
  They'll know where
 to find me.<br>
  âListen Bill, you think
 your boss gives you a hard time now?"
  "You're gonna get a really hard time
 right after I walk out of here.<br>"
  "I'm not rescheduling, Bill.<br>"
  "When I walk out that door,
 I'm never coming back.<br>"
  That's your ass, Bill.<br>
  I really think you
 should look me up.<br>
  It It just doesn't work
 like that, I'm sorry, sir.<br>
  You take care, okay?
  I'm coming out,
 it's not working.<br>
  It's gonna work.<br>
 Hang in there.<br>
  I was being too weird.<br>
  Just like every
 other tech billionaire.<br>
  Slow your roll,
 it's gonna happen.<br>
  It's no wonder Wikipedia is
 never accurate, anyone can edit them.<br>
  Well, not anyone.<br>
  Nerds like Mobley built
 a lot of credit over the years
  With his 20,000 edits.<br>
  And still, people trust it.<br>
  Beholden to all the Mobley's of
 the world for their information.<br>
  Mr.<br> Sepiol?
 Uh, Mr.<br> Sepiol!
  I have some good news.<br>
  Stop it.<br> Stop it.<br> Can you
 stop packing for like five minutes?
  Can we just hash this
 out like adults? I love you.<br>
  You don't even know
 why you're crying.<br>
  Let's get married.<br>
  Ollie, will you please stop?
  Angela, Angela, you canât just
 give up on us like this.<br>
  I mean have you
 even thought this through?
  What are you gonna do? Go
 live with your dad in Jersey?
  Come on.<br>
  You're ruining your life.<br>
 Maybe.<br>
  But I also ruined yours.<br>
  Why do you have my work ID?
  Did you Do you
 Do you
  Do you know what's gonna happen?
  There will be fallout from
 this and I'm gonna tell them.<br>
  I used your computer.<br>
  So, tell them whatever you want.<br>
  Are you seriously
  Did you even think about
 how this would affect me?
  I did.<br>
  Here's an idea of
 how big this place is.<br>
  We have our own fire department.<br>
  Inside the building.<br>
 Just for us.<br>
  And you can't have a fire
 department without a fire truck.<br>
  And you can't have
 a fire truck without roads.<br>
  We have all of that.<br>
  Inside.<br> Imagine that.<br>
  Elliot, now's the
 time we get rid of Bill.<br>
  There's so much information
  Okay.<br> We're gonna
 need to roll up our sleeves.<br>
  You have to destroy Bill in
 order to get to his supervisor.<br>
  There's one vault in here
 that's 200,000 square feet.<br>
  That's the size
 of a shopping mall.<br>
  And that's just one.<br>
  Bill, where
 Where are those giant vaults?
  Oh, they're on Level Two.<br> But
 that's not part of the tour.<br>
  Even I don't have authorization.<br>
  He's not gonna take you
 for ice cream.<br> He has to go away.<br>
  There's no place
 in this plan for Bill.<br>
  Now, right down here
  Everything okay, sir?
  We need to tear
 Bill down, piece by piece.<br>
  You need to wipe that
 smile off of his stupid face.<br>
  Sir, are you okay?
  You're not
 You're not saying anything.<br>
  Dig into him, Elliot.<br>
  You of all people
 can do this, Elliot.<br>
  You know how it feels when
 someone makes you small.<br>
  You understand what happens
 when someone exposes the thing
  you fear most about yourself.<br>
  - Answer me! Answer me!
  Get up.<br>
  Just get
  I hate you.<br>
  You're nothing.<br>
  You're worthless.<br>
  Think about it, Bill.<br>
 Think about what?
  If you died, would anyone care?
  Would they really care?
  Yeah, maybe they'd
 cry for a day,
  but, let's be honest,
 no one would give a shit.<br>
  They wouldn't.<br>
  The few people that would feel
 obligated to go to your funeral
  would probably be annoyed and
 leave as early as possible.<br>
  That's who you are,
 that's what you are.<br>
  You're nothing to anyone.<br>
  To everyone.<br>
  Think about it, Bill.<br>
  Because if you do,
 if you let yourself,
  you'll know
 I'm telling you the truth.<br>
  So, instead of wasting
 any more of my time,
  I need you to go call
 someone that matters.<br>
  Because, Bill
  You don't.<br>
  I'll, um
 I'll call my supervisor.<br>
  And that's why Bill
 Harper is a perfect exploit.<br>
  Desperate enough for the business
 to break protocol and let me in.<br>
  Lonely enough to break.<br>
  I need a supervisor
 in L-1, S-3.<br>
  Copy that.<br>
  Don't Don't apologize.<br>
  You're almost there.<br>
 You did great.<br>
  Once Wendy gets there,
 we'll send her a text
  letting her know her
 pregnant wife is in labor.<br>
  Once she leaves, that should give you
 enough time to plant the Pi, you dig?
  Trudy Davis, Accounts Supervisor.<br>
 Is there a problem here?
  Mr.<br> Sepiol
 Trudy?
  is asking for someone
 more senior than me.<br>
  I don't seem to have your name.<br>
  I'm Sam Sepiol?
  Is that a question?
  Trudy? Trudy?
 Wendy.<br>
  We only prepped for Wendy.<br>
 Where the hell is Wendy?
  I need Wendy, actually.<br>
  How do you know Wendy?
 She didn't come in today.<br>
  What is it that
 you need Mr.<br> Sepiol?
  Um, I would love
 a tour of Level Two.<br>
  I don't know what you've been
 told but we don't allow that.<br>
  I'll see you out.<br>
 You can go, Bill.<br>
  Follow me to the lobby.<br>
  This woman's a ghost.<br>
 None of these are her.<br>
  No Facebook, no Linkedln.<br>
  She's been married for 30 years.<br>
  All we have is her husband's
 cell phone number,
  he doesn't even have
 a picture online.<br>
  No hobbies, no kids, no credit problems,
 no weird sex stuff.<br> House paid off.<br>
  So, I need
 I need to think.<br>
  The elevator's almost here.<br>
  Yes.<br> That's how they work
 when you press the button.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  People People are
 all just people, right?
  When it gets down to it, everyone
 is the same.<br> They love something.<br>
  They want something.<br>
 They fear something.<br>
  Specifics help, but specifics don't change
 the ways that everyone is vulnerable.<br>
  It just changes the way that we
 access those vulnerabilities.<br>
  I, uh, I have to go.<br> I'm sorry.<br>
 I need to go to my office.<br>
  Reception will see you out.<br>
  - What'd you do?
 - I spoofed a text from her husband.<br>
  - It's a palm print scanner.<br>
 - Get out of there.<br>
  There's one door
 manually locked.<br>
  It's a fire code thing and
 I think you can pick it.<br>
  Where?
  It's at the end of the hallway
 if you're heading north on L-1.<br>
  The stairs don't go to Level Two.<br>
 They go to a parking lot.<br>
  You're on the complete
 wrong side of the building.<br>
  You're gonna have to double back
  and go through the door you
 came in and make a run for it.<br>
  Elliot?
  I thought I saw you.<br>
 What are you doing here?
  Thank you! Y'all
 come back to Wingstravaganza.<br>
  Okay, real important, Wingstravaganza
 means "wings" and "extravaganza.<br>"
  Oh, do you know what
 "extravaganza" means?
  Yep.<br> It's a big deal.<br>
 You got it.<br>
  Mmm-hmm.<br>
 You look nervous.<br>
  Are you excited?
  - Oh, yeah.<br> - Okay.<br> So, you'll
 shadow me for the week.<br>
  But don't sweat it.<br> It's
 like every other server job.<br>
  Well, I've actually never
 been a waitress before.<br>
  Oh.<br> This is kinda like a
 new beginning for me.<br>
  What were you doing before?
  Pharmaceutical sales.<br>
 Fancy.<br> You must've made bank.<br>
  What happened?
 Um, you know, Obamacare.<br>
  Right this way.<br>
  Welcome to
 Steel Mountain's data center.<br>
  Our facility meets
 diamond specifications
  and features a tier-10
 certified build and design,
  providing you with a safe, rock-solid
 fortress for your data needs.<br>
  All of our facilities implement
 comprehensive security
  measures including rigorous
 background checks
  Exactly.<br>
  So, yeah.<br> Elliot.<br>
  Nice meeting you.<br>
 You, too.<br>
  Tell your wife I said hi.<br>
 I will.<br>
  Those men I just
 shook hands with,
  financiers of
 Hezbollah and ISIS.<br>
  I wouldn't stare.<br>
  Did he know
 I was gonna be here?
  Does he know why I'm here?
 Shit, he's gonna kill me.<br>
  As you were saying
  Uh, just a routine
 data process check.<br>
  Allsafe does 'em all the time.<br>
  But why would they send you?
  That type of thing isn't usually
 handled by the engineers, is it?
  We've been overlapping
 a lot in our duties.<br>
  Budget reasons.<br>
  It seems we both had the idea
 to work off-site today.<br>
  Let's call this fortuitous.<br>
 Join me for lunch?
  Sure Sure.<br>
 I eat lunch.<br>
  So you are
 like the rest of us.<br>
  Come.<br>
  He got owned man.<br>
 We gotta go!
  We're not going anywhere.<br>
 This changes nothing.<br>
  What can I get you, Elliot?
  They have a lot of things here.<br>
  He has a vulnerability.<br>
  He's an arrogant prick.<br>
 And he's proud of it.<br>
  He cares what you
 think about him,
  even though he probably
 hates that he does.<br>
  Tyrell Wellick's
 greatest asset is his hubris,
  but it's also his flaw.<br>
 And that's your exploit.<br>
  would be nice.<br>
  You eat here?
  This place?
  Is that your plan?
 To piss him off?
  No, wait, man.<br> Wait.<br>
  Now, remember, Elliot,
 you lose our signal on Level Two.<br>
  Elliot?
  Elliot? Can you
 even hear us?
  I'm impressed you came
 all the way out here.<br>
  Allsafe is finished,
 but you won't let it die.<br>
  We're the same.<br>
 We're perfectionists.<br>
  I've seen our waiter here
 for the last seven years.<br>
  He must be in his fifties.<br>
  Maybe has kids, divorced,
 second wife, more kids.<br>
  And I wonder
 what must he think of himself?
  His life's potential reached
 at a 30-grand a year salary.<br>
  An economy car he
 still owes money on.<br>
  A two-bedroom apartment.<br>
 Child support.<br> Coupons.<br>
  I couldn't bear it.<br>
 A life like that.<br>
  The life of
 an ordinary cockroach
  whose biggest value
 is to serve me salad.<br>
  as a backup.<br>
  I'm getting
 a signal on that right now.<br>
  I have to go
 to the bathroom.<br>
  Goddamn withdrawals again.<br>
  Or is it Tyrell Wellick?
 Is he toying with me?
  What kind of game
 are we playing?
  Am I his malware?
  I had to wash my face.<br>
  Hard to breathe here.<br>
  I know you framed Terry Colby.<br>
  I I didn't.<br> Your father worked
 at Evil Corp before he died.<br>
  That's a matter
 of public record.<br>
  I'm not turning you in, if
 that's what you're thinking.<br>
  I don't even have proof, and
 even if I did, I don't care.<br>
  I just wanted to know your
 weakness and now I do.<br>
  Revenge.<br>
  How ordinary.<br>
  It's like our waiter.<br>
  But even extraordinary people,
  and I believe you are, are
 driven by human banalities.<br>
  And unfortunately,
 we're all human.<br>
  Except me, of course.<br>
  I'm joking, Elliot.<br> Enjoy
 your long drive back home.<br>
  I'm having a helicopter
 take me back to New York.<br>
  You take care, Elliot.<br>
  No.<br> Bullshit.<br>
  Dude, bullshit.<br>
 What did they say?
  Oh, I don't know, basically that
 they're a bunch of dickless assholes.<br>
  Where you going?
 To fix it.<br>
  No one else is going to.<br>
  Darlene, wait.<br>
  I really don't think you
 should keep pushing them.<br>
  Put it this way, either I'm
 fixing this or breaking it.<br>
  Their call.<br>
  Hi, pumpkin.<br>
  Hey, Daddy.<br>
  Why aren't you at work?
  I broke up with Ollie.<br>
  I know.<br> Just got off
 the phone with him.<br>
  Come on.<br>
  He was sobbing.<br>
  He wanted me to tell
 you something like,
  "I'll always love you.<br>
 Please come back.<br>"
  Oh, and he can
 learn to forgive you.<br>
  Jesus.<br>
  What did you say?
  I told him that I thought you should
 have broken up with him a long time ago
  and hung up on him.<br>
 Nice.<br>
  What did he mean, anyway?
  Just normal work
 and money stuff.<br>
  And, well, he cheated on me.<br>
  So, there's that.<br>
  Well, the cheating part,
 I'm not surprised.<br>
  Not trying to make you feel
 bad, honey, but come on,
  the kid's a douchebag.<br>
  As for the money
 Dad, no.<br>
  I'll float you some money.<br>
  For professional development.<br>
 Dad.<br>
  Call it a loan.<br>
  But do not pay me back.<br>
  And you'll stay here and commute
 until you can save for an apartment.<br>
  I can't make you do any of that.<br>
 And you didn't.<br>
  It's what I want.<br>
  Are you hungry?
  Yeah.<br>
 No, no.<br> Sit.<br> Sit, sit.<br> Relax.<br>
  What would you like?
  You don't need to
 cook for me, Dad.<br>
  French toast, coming up!
  Mmm-hmm.<br>
  Shh.<br>
  Why are they backing out?
  This is a library.<br>
  You want to discuss that,
 go back to the IRC island.<br>
  They banned
 me from the channel.<br>
  What happened?
  We just owned Steel Mountain.<br> We
 did our part and it went perfect.<br>
  Come on, we both know
 that shit didn't go perfect.<br>
  Well, it doesn't matter,
 they called it off.<br>
  We pulled our side together and your
 side called it off like it was nothing.<br>
  You got your answer.<br>
  You better tell
 your pal Whiterose
  to stop being a pussy
 and start growing a pair
  because we don't have
 time to dilly-dally around.<br>
  And now you're gonna talk
 about this in the world?
  Do you even care who hears you?
  Face it, Darlene, it's over.<br>
  Walk away.<br>
  I can't go back to
 my people with that.<br>
  Tell me why.<br>
  You said the Dark Army
 was with us on this.<br>
  Between us?
  I'm not about to
 goddamn tweet about it.<br>
  They were out before you
 ever got to Steel Mountain.<br>
  I don't know why.<br>
 That's all they said to me.<br>
  I know you had your heart set, but
 for real this time, just let it go.<br>
  I meet suits, mostly.<br>
  No, I imagine it must be
 exciting to work in government.<br>
  It's like a spy movie.<br>
  Can you read my secret emails?
  No.<br>  My job is mostly
 paperwork and bureaucracy.<br>
  They always want more
 than the technology allows.<br>
  I don't even have time to
 read your secret emails.<br>
  But it's a stopgap.<br>
 For me, I'm restless.<br>
  So, I'm always itching
 for something else.<br>
  There have been a lot of something elses.<br>
  For both of us.<br> Mmm-hmm.<br>
  Before this, I worked at an NGO.<br>
  And before that I worked at,
 um, Microsoft for a year,
  which felt like a decade.<br>
  Your place is beautiful.<br>
  I wish I could take
 the compliment.<br>
  The decorating
 is Scott's domain.<br>
  No? Really?
 Yes.<br>
  Very nice.<br>
 Yeah.<br>
  Where's all the
 The antiques from?
  They're They're
  So they tapped you for CTO, yes?
  Don't be surprised.<br>
  Suspicious is more accurate.<br>
  I was beginning to wonder
 why you set this dinner.<br>
  Four people in the world
 know about my conversations.<br>
  And somehow, you're number five.<br>
  Then I'm exactly what you
 need in a right hand.<br>
  So, that's what this is about?
  Isn't everything
 about something?
  Like we were thinking
 about, is it baby-proof?
  Uh-huh.<br>  Yeah, that's
 That's a consideration.<br>
  If you were me, would you
 trust you as your right hand?
  If I were you, I wouldn't have
 even let me in the house.<br>
  Hey.<br>
  Hey.<br> It's me.<br>
 Is now a good time?
  Yeah.<br>
 I'm at my new job.<br>
  - How's it goin'? -
 Seriously, it's hard as hell,
  but I'm getting the hang of it.<br>
  At first it took me, like,
 years to marry ketchups,
  but it turns out, I'm amazing at
 upselling expensive cocktails.<br>
  I'm not surprised.<br>
  And then when I have
 to put together to-go orders,
  it's like bagging molly
 so I'm like kind of an expert.<br>
  How are you?
  I'm good.<br>
  Wow.<br> I've never heard you say a
 sentence like that before, ever.<br>
  I did what I had to do today.<br>
  Well, if you're around tonight, come
 over and tell me about it.<br> Okay?
  I gotta go.<br>
 Okay, bye.<br>
  You seem to know
 how to drink your wine.<br>
  I indulge in few things.<br>
 But, I do love wine.<br>
  Yourself?
  In my other life,
 when I could drink for one.<br>
  But, even then,
 I had cheap tastes.<br>
  It's, uh, safe to smell, though.<br>
 Put your nose in there.<br>
  You know, to me,
 it smells like every wine.<br>
  But I'd love to learn.<br>
 Uh-huh.<br>
  Dried red fruit.<br>
  Fresh violet.<br>
  Uh, lemon peel.<br>
  Try it again.<br>
  Smell.<br> Really, really
 think about it.<br>
  Mmm, I do smell the lemon.<br>
  Sharon?
 Yes?
  How do you not
 blow your brains out
  being married to him?
  Excuse me?
  Shall I repeat the question?
  You're a guest in our house.<br>
 A very honest one.<br>
  Wow.<br>
  I think I'll mistake
 what you said
  as a joke in poor taste and
 excuse myself to the bathroom.<br>
  Well, I have a beautiful
 vintage over here.<br>
  I would love to just
 show you the label.<br>
  Let's see here.<br> Nope.<br>
  Nope.<br>
 There's the one.<br>
  This is my prized possession, actually.<br>
 Take a look at this.<br>
  I'm in here.<br>
  Can I help you?
  Thank you for a lovely evening.<br>
  Siege and storm!
  We got problems.<br>
 Is the Pi online?
  Yeah, we're in the whole system.<br>
  We could deliver the whole
 payload right now if we wanted.<br>
  - And yet, I hear no applause.<br>
 - Then applaud.<br>
  You have to tell them.<br>
  What?
  We lost China.<br>
  I'm sorry?
 The Dark Army is bailing.<br>
  - Why? - They don't answer
 "whys," apparently.<br>
  That's no problem, we'll just call 'em
 back, we'll set up another meeting ASAP
  Dude, did you not hear me? They've
 gone dark.<br> It's not happening.<br>
  I know, I know.<br>
 I get it, okay, I fucked up.<br>
  Let's not wait, then.<br>
 Let's do it anyway.<br>
  Just us.<br> Let's do it.<br> Right now.<br>
  Okay? We execute now.<br>
  We execute on our side
 and trust that the Dark Army
  gets their shit
 together and follows.<br>
  Why do they get to dictate
 terms? We dictate terms.<br>
  Shh, shh, shh.<br>
 We can go now.<br>
  If we move forward and they don't, China
 still holds all the redundant information.<br>
  It will be pointless.<br>
  And if we wait,
 it'll also be pointless.<br>
  Everything you guys did
 today would be for nothing.<br>
  Ah, are you crazy!
  It will have no effect!
  It'll take down their network for weeks.<br>
 They'll recover!
  It would still hurt them.<br>
  We don't want to hurt them,
 we want to kill them.<br>
  And neither will happen
 if we do nothing, right now.<br>
  What are you doing? Huh?
  Take another step,
 and I'll do it.<br>
  Think about what you're doing.<br>
  Okay? All right?
  In a month, they're gonna be up and
 running again with even better security.<br>
  We are not gonna
 get another shot at this.<br>
  The revolution that we've always
 talked about will be gone.<br>
  Dead and buried.<br>
  We will have failed
 because of you.<br>
  Please, do not do this.<br>
  Is there anyone here who can
 communicate with this woman?
  Please.<br>
  Tell me it's okay to execute.<br>
  But we were so close.<br>
  It's not over.<br>
  We'll rework it.<br>
 We'll figure something out.<br>
  We got this far,
  we'll find a way.<br>
 Just not tonight.<br>
  This is all my fault.<br>
  Come on.<br> You can
 crash at my place.<br>
  My father picked
 me up from school one day
  and we played hooky
 and went to the beach.<br>
  It was too cold
 to go in the water
  so we sat on a blanket
 and ate pizza.<br>
  When I got home,
 my sneakers were full of sand
  and I dumped it
 on my bedroom floor.<br>
  I didn't know the
 difference.<br> I was six.<br>
  My mother screamed
 at me for the mess.<br>
  But, he wasn't mad.<br>
  He said that billions of
 years ago the world shifting
  and oceans moving brought that
 sand to that spot on the beach
  and then I took it away.<br>
  "Every day," he said,
 "we change the world.<br>"
  Which is a nice thought until I think
 about how many days and lifetimes
  I would need to bring a shoe full of
 sand home until there is no beach.<br>
  Until it made
 a difference to anyone.<br>
  Every day we change the world,
  but to change the world
 in a way that means anything,
  that takes more time
 than most people have.<br>
  It never happens all at once.<br>
  It's slow.<br> It's methodical.<br>
 It's exhausting.<br>
  We don't all have
 the stomach for it.<br>
  Hey, sweetie.<br>
  I'm gonna go for a run.<br>
  Nice.<br>
  Shayla's got the dog.<br> She
 doesn't shit on her pillows.<br>
  That's a plus, I guess.<br>
  - Shayla?
 - Hey, bro.<br>
  Sometimes, the universe
 aligns perfectly.<br>
  Here I am, locked away, but
 still, it brings you right to me.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
