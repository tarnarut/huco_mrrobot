 The redundant backups, their
 Eastern data center in China
  The Dark Army
 is covering us on that.<br>
  We can go now.<br>
  If we move forward
 and they don't
  China still holds all
 the redundant information.<br>
  It will be pointless.<br>
  If we can talk
 to Whiterose directly
  No way he's meeting
 you face-to-face.<br>
  You fools actually
 got your wish.<br>
  I don't know why, but the
 meeting's actually gonna be on.<br>
  I'd tell you to be careful but I know
 that's the last thing you're gonna be.<br>
  I had the sys admin check that
 server again.<br> Of course there was nothing.<br>
  I have no idea what there was
 to even be suspicious about.<br>
  Why do you have my work ID?
  I placed a malicious CD
 in my work computer.<br>
  I need you to do
 something for me.<br>
  Our new Chief Technology
 Officer, Scott Knowles.<br>
  Meet me tonight
 on the roof.<br>
  The cameras have been out since March.<br>
 No one will know.<br>
  Stop!
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
  What if
 this all went away?
  The city.<br> The money.<br>
  All Of it.<br>
  What? Like a zombie
 apocalypse or something?
  More like a revolution.<br>
  Last time we hooked up, we agreed
 to check politics at the door.<br>
  There's no middle anymore.<br>
 It's just rich and poor.<br>
  Okay.<br> This shit is way too
 heavy for me this early.<br>
  I gotta go to work.<br>
 Right.<br>
  Solving the world's problems
 one spreadsheet at a time.<br>
  Hey, it's either suits like me
 or the government.<br>
  And we all know how well
 they handle things.<br>
  Why can't the world
 just take care of itself?
  Because the world is filled
 with stupid people.<br>
  And I get paid a lot
 to be smart.<br>
  Hey
  There's not just
 the rich and the poor.<br>
  There's you in the middle
 somewhere, the consummate survivor.<br>
  I'm in a ballet class right now.<br>
  No, Ollie, I can't talk to
 you about this right now.<br>
  I don't care, Ollie.<br>
  I don't care who you ran
 into or what he said.<br>
  Sorry.<br>
  Tell me you're not getting
 back together with him.<br>
  Jesus, no.<br> No.<br> Just
 leftover work stuff.<br>
  Have you talked to Elliot?
  Yesterday.<br>
  Seems like he's pulling himself
 together, but you know how he is.<br>
  Feels like I'm always worried
 about him, you know? Yeah.<br>
  - He's had a shitty month.<br>
 - Or 20 years,
  - take your pick.<br>
 - Then, why are we the ones
  that always end up so stressed?
  Try waking up
 in your childhood bedroom,
  then taking Jersey Transit
 for two hours
  to make a 7:00 ballet
 class in the city.<br>
  Well, silver lining,
 you get to see moi.<br>
  All right, everyone.<br>
 First position.<br>
  I hurt Krista.<br>
 I don't feel good about that.<br>
  I hope you're not mad at me.<br>
  But you have to admit
 she's just like everyone else.<br>
  Too afraid to peek over their walls,
 for fear of what they might see.<br>
  Not me.<br> That's what I do.<br>
  I look.<br>
  Did you get everybody back?
  Tell him to follow the proper commands
 or the sequence won't initiate.<br>
  Using the back door, we planted
 with our Raspberry Pi.<br>
  Jesus Christ, man.<br> How long have
 you been sitting on all this?
  I installed a patch four weeks ago
 and I've been monitoring it daily.<br>
  No rest for the wicked.<br>
  I wanted to make sure it was all updated
 at the Steel Mountain locations
  before the meeting with Whiterose.<br>
 - Yeah.<br>
  These AirDream guys are so dumb.<br>
  Who has all their thermostats
 phone home to the same network?
  I'll sync up all five locations so
 they heat at exactly the same rate.<br>
  No offense, but I'll handle that.<br>
 You should take care of the alarms,
  so there's no signal of the
 temp raise in any vaults.<br>
  No, reroute
 AirDream's traffic.<br>
  Make sure to erase any
 and all signs of our activity.<br>
  Where were you?
 - I need a word.<br>
  I gotta get to work.<br>
 - Not sure that's wise.<br>
  What the hell is that?
 - They're following me.<br>
  And they're probably
 following you too.<br>
  They were on the subway.<br> Okay,
 Cisco's warned me about them.<br>
  These guys are
 dangerous, Elliot.<br>
  The Whiterose meet might not
 go down the way we want it to.<br>
  Yeah, well, I don't even know
 how to use a gun.<br>
  Besides, I'm not even sure I'm
 the one they wanna meet with.<br>
  You're definitely the one
 they want to meet with.<br>
  And when you do,
 you need to be careful.<br>
  I'm serious, Elliot.<br>
  What are you doing?
 I'm calling myself from your phone,
  that way we have
 each other's number.<br>
  Wait, Darlene.<br>
 We don't do that.<br>
  That's to protect fsociety.<br> Okay, but we
 need to protect each other right now.<br>
  Lose Darlene's number.<br>
 It's a rule for a reason.<br>
  Don't worry,
 I'm not gonna use it.<br>
  She's right about one thing.<br>
  You're the one
 they wanna talk to.<br>
  We can't afford
 any distractions.<br>
  He's so obvious, why
 don't you just kill me now?
  - Oh! - Jesus, Blake! Were
 you fucking tip-toeing?
  God damn it,
 look what you've done.<br>
  Watch where you're going!
  But you
  - Good morning.<br> - Not now, Elizabeth.<br>
 Hold all calls.<br>
  Cancel any meetings.<br>
 I'm busy today.<br>
  But, Mr.<br> Wellick.<br>
  Gideon Goddard
 is here to see you.<br>
  I'm sorry.<br> He was very persistent.<br>
 He wouldn't leave.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  Okay.<br>
 No, that's fine.<br>
  Thank you.<br>
 Uh, do you want me to, uh
  Oh, yes.<br>
 I'd love some coffee.<br>
  One of my employees
  confessed to breaking
 chain of custody
  with the Colby .<br>DAT file.<br>
  Unfortunately, this admission
  will render the
 evidence inadmissible,
  and Colby free of charges.<br> Now before
 you say anything, I want to assure you
  that Allsafe has doubled its
 efforts to find the hackers,
  whether it be reconfirming
 Colby's involvement,
  or finding
 the real perpetrators.<br>
  We've air gapped
 your private network,
  implemented a honeypot,
 reconfigured all firewalls,
  - and systematically
 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br>
  A honeypot? For what?
  Uh, a specific server involved
 in the last fsociety attack.<br>
  CS30.<br>
  I know we checked it out,
  but if there's even a chance
  the hackers are
 still in the network,
  the honeypot will ensure
  that they can't
 cause any damage.<br>
  They'll log into the decoy server we've set
 up thinking they're on your main network.<br>
  And I'm personally
 keeping tabs on all traffic.<br>
  So you have our full attention.<br>
  Well, I appreciate
 your transparency.<br>
  Well, so, you understand then?
  Of course.<br>
 Good.<br>
  In fact, I'd like to look
 over your findings,
  especially this server.<br>
  So, please send me the research.<br>
  Of course.<br> Of course.<br>
 Yeah.<br>
  Well, thank you again
 for seeing me.<br>
  Mr.<br> Wellick?
  Mr.<br> Wellick?
  I specifically asked
 not to be disturbed.<br>
  I know, but, um
  What is it?
  The police.<br>
  It's awful.<br>
  - What about the police?
 - They found a body on the roof.<br>
  A body? Who?
  They're not saying, but detectives came by.<br>
 They want to speak with you.<br>
  With me?
  They're questioning everyone who
 was at the reception last night.<br>
  Clearly this is tragic, but
 unfortunately work goes on.<br>
  But don't you think you should
 - Tell them,
  they can set an appointment.<br>
  I'd be happy to speak
 with them then.<br>
  Oh, and Elizabeth,
  I need you to connect me
 with the Dulles Server Farm.<br>
  I'll take it on my mobile.<br>
  And the file shares? 'Cause client data
 is inaccessible until we're back online.<br>
  Jumping on that now.<br>
  Check the logs on
 the ASA firewall.<br>
  I want a full report.<br>
  Ollie, sales.<br>
  All appointments at Allsafe
  are canceled
 until further notice.<br>
  Word of this cannot get out.<br>
  All right, let's get to it.<br>
  This hack is
 far from devastating.<br>
  They already own us.<br>
  They're not going after
 anything valuable.<br>
  This is more of a distraction.<br>
  But what are they trying
 to distract us from?
  Hey, bro.<br>
  Always the chatterbox.<br>
  You're sweating.<br>
  Oh.<br> yeah?
  Yeah, yeah, maybe a little.<br>
  Been running around.<br>
  Um, look, I sort of need you
 to handle something for me.<br>
  What've they got you doing here?
  I'm trying to reverse
 engineer the malware.<br>
  Okay, um, I'm gonna need
 you to stop doing that
  and take these
 corrupted drives over to
  Blank's Disk Recovery
 on 36th and Fifth.<br>
  Why me?
 Get one of the IT guys.<br>
  Everyone is swamped, Elliot.<br>
  Dude, this isn't,
 like, a debate.<br>
  I've always wanted things
 to be cool between us, but
  I outrank you.<br>
  So
  Here are the drives.<br>
  Your appointment is at 2:00.<br>
  You cannot be late.<br>
  In fact, um, how about
 you leave right now?
  It's only 12:00.<br>
  Elliot, bro.<br>
  Just, just do me
 this solid, okay?
  He wasn't
 just stressed.<br>
  He was scared.<br>
  Let's see what he's hiding.<br>
  What does Angela
 have to do with this?
  Well
  Why didn't you tell me?
  And say what?
  "Hey, Elliot, there's a bunch of nude pics of
 me that some asshole wants to leak online?"
  I could've helped.<br>
 You weren't around.<br>
  Yeah.<br>
  I've kind of had a rough month.<br>
  I'm sorry.<br>
  Tell me what happened.<br>
  We were being pressured.<br>
  By who?
  Some guy.<br>
  He gave Ollie a CD
 that infected his laptop,
  stole his pictures, his
 emails, and browser cache.<br>
  He said to install the disk at Allsafe
 or he would leak everything online.<br>
  It was a while ago.<br>
 I thought he forgot about us.<br>
  I was right,
 the hack was a distraction.<br>
  This is about me.<br>
 This is the meeting.<br>
  You should've come to me.<br>
  I told you, you weren't there.<br>
  You're never there anymore.<br>
  Something is going on
 with you, Elliot.<br>
  You have not been the same
 the past couple of months,
  and this happened before Shayla.<br>
  You're wrong.<br>
 You're lying.<br>
  You don't talk to me anymore.<br>
  Just tell me what to do here,
  because the only solution
 I can think of is to give up.<br>
  God, say something.<br>
  You're right.<br>
  We don't talk anymore.<br>
  It's so strange.<br>
  I really miss us.<br>
  Why is that strange?
  Because I never thought
 I'd have to.<br>
  Hackers.<br>
  We inherently trust no one,
 including each other.<br>
  I'll never be able to tell her.<br>
  There will always be
 this divide,
  my wall that
 she can't look over.<br>
  And she knows it.<br>
  Trust issues.<br>
  The Dark Army has taken
 extraordinary steps
  to make sure this meeting
 is exactly how they want it.<br>
  Is that why the infamous
 Whiterose is such a legend?
  Because he's more paranoid
 than the rest of us?
  I'm Elliot Alderson.<br>
  A Faraday cage.<br>
  A room specifically designed to
 prevent electromagnetic interference.<br>
  No radio.<br>
 No signal.<br>
  No Wi-Fi.<br>
 Nothing to hack.<br>
  I think I'm here to see you.<br>
  Am I supposed to follow you?
  Are you just
 going to stand there?
  Or do you want to
 hand me those drives?
  Mmm, mmm, mmm.<br>
  This meeting has started.<br>
  I manage my time very carefully, Mr.<br>
 Alderson.<br>
  Each beep indicates one minute
 of my time that has passed.<br>
  I have allotted you
 no more than three minutes.<br>
  Are you really gonna do that?
  I suggest you pick better
 topics of conversation.<br>
  I have 17 more items
 on my agenda today.<br>
  The Evil Corp hack.<br> We should
 go through with it this time.<br>
  You are turning out to be
 a grave disappointment.<br>
  We were ready.<br> We had
 everything set to go.<br>
  Dwelling is so inefficient.<br>
  Hey, you pulled out last time.<br>
  Wasting more time telling me things
 I already know, tsk, tsk, tsk.<br>
  But we were ready.<br> That is the third
 time that you have expressed that.<br>
  She's trolling me.<br>
  You have not advanced
 this conversation.<br>
  Do you intend to?
 - Since last month,
  Evil Corp has moved its tapes to
 - Five backup facilities,
  and you have a plan to
 take them all down?
  Yes.<br> Finally, you have
 communicated something.<br>
  So are you ready
 to do this or not?
  You are the one
 who is not ready.<br>
  It was you who failed all along.<br>
  What you lacked was focus.<br>
  You strayed from the hack
 to target Terry Colby.<br>
  This opened a vulnerability.<br>
  Suspicion.<br> Specifically
 by Gideon Goddard.<br>
  That's why you hacked Allsafe.<br>
  To monitor his activities.<br>
  And that's when we discovered
  that he turned
 your infected server
  into a honeypot.<br>
  Oh, 60 seconds and
 this meeting will be over.<br>
  Wait.<br> The concept of
 "waiting" bewilders me.<br>
  There are always deadlines, there
 are always ticking clocks.<br>
  That's why you must
 manage your time.<br>
  I'll find a way to
 remove the honeypot.<br>
  Until 16 seconds ago,
  you were not aware
 there was a honeypot.<br>
  This does not inspire confidence.<br>
 - Wait.<br>
  There's that word again.<br>
 We'll take care of it.<br>
  You know, you could have told us
 about the honeypot weeks ago.<br>
  Every hacker has her fixation.<br>
 You hack people, I hack time.<br>
  So you should know that when I set
 a timeline, there's a reason.<br>
  You have 50 hours
 and 23 minutes.<br>
  At that point when all parties are
 ready we will initiate the hack.<br>
  We'll do it.<br>
  - Maybe next time
 - Understand something, Mr.<br> Alderson.<br>
  After I leave, you will
 never see me again.<br>
  There are very people in my life
 that I have enough time to see
  more than once and
 you are not one of them.<br>
  Trust me.<br>
  That's not going to matter.<br>
  Why are you doing all of this?
  The hack?
  Why are you working with us?
  50 hours
 and 20 minutes left.<br>
  I need to figure this out.<br>
  Gideon's been spying
 on me the whole time.<br>
  Honeypot service order.<br>
 Shit.<br>
  I gotta do that now.<br>
 Security token.<br>
  Gideon's phone.<br>
 I need his phone.<br>
  50 hours and 19 minutes left.<br>
  Damn.<br> She infected me
 with her time paranoia.<br>
  We're all living
 in each other's paranoia.<br>
  You definitely can't argue that.<br>
  Is that why everyone
 tries to avoid each other?
  I need to calm down.<br>
  I wish I could be
 an observer like you.<br>
  Then I could think more calmly.<br>
  This is comfortable.<br>
  Less stressful.<br>
  In fact, I feel like
 I can see everything,
  know everything this way.<br>
  Hmm
  Do you know more than me?
  That wouldn't be fair.<br>
  My imaginary friend
 knowing more than me.<br>
  So what would you do now?
  We need a distraction
 to get Gideon's phone.<br>
  Darlene?
  I need you to do
 something for me.<br>
  She can help.<br>
  My boss at Allsafe, Gideon.<br>
  Sometimes it's hard
 to listen to an explanation.<br>
  Even when it's from myself.<br>
  Especially when
 it's from myself.<br>
  It would be so much easier to only
 pay attention when I needed to.<br>
  Yeah.<br>
 To just
  Arrive at the conclusion.<br>
  Is that what you do?
  One hundred large MMS files
 to Gideon's phone, drained it.<br>
  Corporate greed is
 a trickle-down desire
  that reaches even
 the bottom of the food chain.<br>
  And for what? Wealth?
  What the shit?
 - Power?
  It's a pathetic fable and you,
  Allsafe, are a defender
 of this pitiful avarice
  Holy shit.<br>
 Fsociety knows us.<br>
  But your sweet dream is over, and
 your nightmare is about to begin.<br>
  We are warned that
 those who are complicit
  What the hell's happening now?
 those who aide the tyrant,
  those who accept the tyranny,
  have no place in the new order.<br>
  The distraction
 is momentary.<br>
  Hopefully all I need.<br>
  They will know our justice
 and we will show no mercy.<br>
  Gideon Goddard,
  you are a lackey
 to your corporate overlords.<br>
  Someone shut this off.<br>
  Defending those
 that bleed the innocent.<br>
  Serving them.<br>
 Slave to master.<br>
  It's ignoring
 the remote.<br>
  They hacked our Smart TV.<br>
  Congratulations,
 Mr.<br> Goddard.<br>
  It's posting to our website.<br>
 And YouTube.<br>
  You will soon be finished.<br>
  In 90 seconds
 this code will change.<br>
  If I don't log in with it
 on my computer before then,
  I'll lose everything to time.<br>
  We are exposing
 your role to the world.<br>
  No, let it finish.<br>
  And the world is very angry.<br>
  Sixty seconds.<br>
 Whiterose was right.<br>
  We run from one deadline
 to the next.<br>
  Where's Elliot?
  What are you doing?
  I was working on
 the local backups.<br>
  Why weren't you
 in there with us?
  I was worried about the
 - It just doesn't add up.<br>
  All these events keep happening
  around your appearance,
 your disappearance.<br>
  Gideon
 - Forget it.<br>
  I don't want to hear it.<br>
  Every member in this company
  stood in there watching the single worst
 thing that's happened to Allsafe,
  and where are you?
 At your cubicle?
  Doing what?
  Gideon, I hate to interrupt you, but
 - No, not now, Ollie.<br>
  Evil Corp's on the phone.<br>
  I'll be back.<br>
 We're not finished here.<br>
  I know, you thought
 I didn't put the code in time,
  but I had to hide it quickly
 before Gideon saw it.<br>
  Sorry.<br>
  Have I told you what I saw
 when I hacked Gideon?
  When I peeked into his secrets?
  I saw a good, honest man.<br>
  Gideon was wrong.<br>
  I am finished here.<br>
  I'm not good for him
 or this place.<br>
  He was only protecting
 his people.<br>
  But me?
  I'm doing this
 to protect everyone.<br>
  It seems you've
 been very busy lately.<br>
  I have to know
 what you're planning.<br>
  We were meant to be allies.<br>
  We might just want
 the same thing.<br>
  And I need to be involved.<br>
  I'm pretty positive you're dead
 wrong about that, my friend.<br>
  I don't think there's anything
 we could possibly agree on.<br>
  I don't know what game
 you're playing,
  but I suggest you
 cut the bullshit.<br>
  If there's nothing else,
 I think we're done here.<br>
  Aren't you forgetting that I
 know your dirty little secret?
  There are people close to you that wouldn't
 be happy if they knew what I know.<br>
  We're both too smart to allow
 pettiness to dictate our actions.<br>
  We're better than that.<br>
  Weigh the pros and cons.<br>
  Do what you need to do,
  but as soon as
 the tabulations are over with,
  you'll know that telling anyone about
 that does neither one of us any good.<br>
  In fact, you'll realize that
  the only thing to do in your
 position when it comes to me,
  is nothing.<br>
  Good evening,
 Mr.<br> Wellick.<br>
  I'm Detective Quattlander,
 this is Detective Jones.<br>
  As I know you're aware,
  we were hoping to speak with
 you at your office today,
  but your assistant
 said you're out.<br>
  What's this about?
  We're investigating
 a murder that occurred
  at your husband's place
 of employment, ma'am.<br>
  May we please come in?
  A murder?
  Ma'am, do you mind speaking
 in English, please?
  I think this
 is inappropriate,
  you coming to
 my house like this,
  upsetting my wife.<br>
  - I will be in my office tomorrow.<br>
 - Mr.<br> Wellick,
  as you can imagine,
 this is very time-sensitive.<br>
  We just need to ask you
 a few questions.<br>
  Actually, both of you,
  since you were both in attendance
 at the reception last night.<br>
  Yeah, I can assure you,
  we have no information
 whatsoever.<br>
  It'll only take a moment.<br>
  And you both did know
 the deceased, Sharon Knowles.<br>
  You did know her, yes?
  Sharon Knowles?
  That's terrible.<br>
  Um, yes, yes, we did know her.<br>
  Please, come in.<br>
  Have a seat.<br> Can I get you anything?
 Coffee, tea?
  Coffee would be great.<br>
  Tea, herbal
 if possible, please.<br>
  Mr.<br> Wellick.<br>
  What time did you last see
 Sharon Knowles last night?
  Mr.<br> Wellick?
  Are you okay?
  Ahhh!
  Joanna?
  Uh, I think the baby's coming.<br> We
 gotta get her to the hospital.<br>
  Okay?
  How'd it go with the
 climate control hack?
  Handled.<br>
  I happen to be really smart
 and good at things.<br>
  Not like you give a shit.<br>
  We should celebrate then.<br>
  In 43 hours,
  exactly,
  our server will
 no longer be a honeypot,
  and that rootkit you wrote,
  will take down Evil Corp.<br>
  We did it, Darlene.<br>
  It's gonna happen.<br>
  We're really doing this?
  Whoo!
  Oh, my God.<br>
  Be happy.<br>
  You did this.<br>
  You did it.<br>
  Just like that, Elliot,
 you're gonna change the world.<br>
  We did this.<br>
  I would love to take
 credit on this one.<br>
  But I can't.<br>
  No, really, this was you.<br>
  You are seriously
  the best person I know,
 you know that?
  I love you so much.<br>
  Oh, my God, Elliot!
 What the fuck?
  I'm sorry.<br> What the
 hell is wrong with you?
  I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br>
 I thought
  I just
  I'm sorry.<br>
  Oh, my God, Elliot.<br>
  Did you forget again?
  Did you forget who I am?
  What do you mean?
  Forget what?
  Elliot, I need you to tell me
 who you think I am.<br>
  What are you talking about?
  Tell me right now.<br>
  What are you saying?
  Elliot
  I mean of course I did
 Didn't forget.<br>
  You're Darlene.<br>
  You're Darlene.<br>
  Elliot.<br>
  You're Darlene.<br>
  I know.<br>
  I know what she's going to say.<br>
  I'm your
 - Sister.<br>
  You're my sister.<br>
  Darlene and I'd hide
 in movie theaters all day.<br>
  Darlene would sing,
 FrÃ¨re Jacques.<br>
  She rode her scooter
 in front of our house.<br>
  I'm crazy.<br> I'm crazy.<br>
 I'm crazy.<br> I'm crazy.<br>
  She tried to run away
 in the third grade.<br>
  How come I didn't remember that?
  We slept in the same bed
 when our mom was mean to us.<br>
  Why did I forget?
 I remember her voice.<br>
  How could I forget?
  I'm crazy.<br> I'm crazy.<br>
  I'm crazy.<br> I'm crazy.<br>
 I'm crazy.<br>
  Are you freaking out?
  Tell me the truth.<br>
  Were you in on this
 the whole time?
  Were you?
  Think, God damn it, think.<br>
  How can I just forget
 her like that?
  A whole person, a relationship.<br>
  Is this amnesia? What else
 am I not remembering?
  I'm crazy.<br> I should have
 stayed on the meds.<br>
  I'm crazy.<br>
 I'm out of my mind.<br>
  I knew it.<br> I should have
 never created you,
  I should have
 listened to Krista.<br>
  I avoid myself.<br>
  Why?
  I'm afraid.<br>
  Okay.<br>
  Afraid of what?
  Finding too much, too little,
 nothing at all?
  Do I even exist?
  See me.<br>
  Elliot Alderson.<br>
  I am here.<br>
  Now I'm gone.<br>
  We have to hack
  Me.<br>
  Nothing.<br>
  No identity.<br>
  I'm a ghost.<br>
  Did I erase myself?
  I think we should talk.<br>
