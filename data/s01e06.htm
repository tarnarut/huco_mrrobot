 Did you have something
 to do with Vera getting busted?
  Who told you to put your business
 anywhere near social media?
  My aspirational little brother.<br>
  Someone's gonna
 get hurt for this.<br>
  What
 happened to Angela?
  She's not gonna work out for us.<br>
  Not on this level.<br>
  You didn't have to stick
 up for me in there.<br>
  Don't do it again!
  Evil Corp tapped you
 for CTO, yes?
  You're ruining your life.<br>
 I also ruined yours.<br>
  Terry Colby was involved
 in the cover-up
  of the Washington Township
 toxic waste scandal.<br>
  Sharon, how do you not blow
 your brains out married to him?
  I'm in here.<br>
  Do you mind sleeping
 here tonight?
  That girl in there is mine.<br>
  If you're around tonight come
 over and tell me about it.<br>
  Shayla?
  Sometimes
 the universe aligns perfectly.<br>
  Here I am locked away, and still
 it brings you right to me.<br>
  I feel the
 sensation, fight-or-flight.<br>
  It's constant.<br>
  I should just pick one.<br>
  I, Elliot Alderson,
 am flight.<br> I am fear.<br>
  I am anxiety, terror, panic.<br>
  Some velvet mornin'
 when I'm straight
  I'm gonna open up your gate
  Doesn't feel real.<br>
  You should eat.<br>
  Not hungry.<br>
  I don't even know
 what I ordered.<br>
  I'm sorry.<br>
  You don't like the guisada?
  Uh, no, it's
 It's good.<br> Thank you.<br>
  What are you thinking about?
  The first time we met.<br>
  Doesn't feel that long ago.<br>
  And now look at us.<br>
  Who woulda thought?
  If I could go back
 and undo this
  You can't.<br>
  You promised me.<br>
  I'm gonna get you
 out of this, okay?
  Time's up.<br>
  Let's go.<br>
 Wait.<br>
  Sit down.<br>
  Come with me.<br>
  Let's go.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
  - Hello? - VERA:
 The origin of your name,
  I looked it up for you, bro.<br>
  Where are you taking her?
  Elliot
  "Brave and true.<br>"
  Did you know the origin of
 "brave" evolved from "savage"?
  I don't know what you
 think this is about.<br>
  But you need to let her go.<br>
  Yeah, well, funny thing.<br> My
 name means something similar.<br>
  "Brave traveler, adventurer.<br>"
  A savage traveler
 becomes a brave traveler.<br>
  Are we savages, or are we brave?
  Don't know, bro.<br>
  Listen to me, man.<br>
  When I found out you did
 this, I didn't get angry.<br>
  I got impressed.<br>
  Your power.<br>
 I want it, Elliot.<br>
  And I want it so bad
 it makes my dick hard.<br>
  And I want it today.<br>
  Yo, I don't know what
 you think I can do,
  I canât just hack
 you out of prison.<br>
  Not all prisons are networked
 and even if yours is,
  it would take weeks
 to find security holes.<br>
  Has to be tonight.<br> I got
 crosshairs on my heart.<br>
  I don't make it out, I'm dead.<br>
  And that ain't meant
 to be just yet.<br>
  You do your thing, bro.<br>
  You're asking the impossible.<br>
  When we cross paths tonight,
 Elliot, I'ma hug you.<br>
  Please listen, man.<br>
 Yo, Shayla.<br>
  This is on me,
  okay? You gotta let her go.<br>
  Oh, that? She cool, bro.<br>
 Trust me, she cool.<br>
  She'll be there tonight, too.<br>
 It'll be one big happy-happy!
  Hey, Elliot.<br>
  I love you, bro.<br>
  Where's Shayla? Man, I'm
 not gonna tell you again.<br>
  Stop askin' so many questions.<br>
  Come on.<br>
  Vera may be
 out of his mind.<br>
  But, yes, it is possible to
 hack into a prison's network.<br>
  Most of them use regular
 industrial control systems.<br>
  I'm a blind man to
 what Vera sees in this dude.<br>
  Amen.<br> Techie computer hacker
 genius, my thick Dominican dick.<br>
  When you
 have control of that,
  you basically have control
 of the cell doors.<br>
  But what these morons
 don't know is,
  it's almost impossible
 without any research.<br>
  Time to shine your
 cojones and get to work.<br>
  Our only rule,
 "Do what we say.<br>"
  You violate that dictate,
  we kill your sweetheart.<br>
  Yo, yo, Isaac, uh,
 how my dic-tate? Mmm?
  Shut up, bitch.<br>
  "Dic-tate.<br>"
  Vera's bro, Isaac.<br>
  Something about him bugs me.<br>
  And you know what I like
 to do when that happens?
  Hi, I'm trying to
 reach Mister Beckett.<br>
  When would Mister
 Lattimer be available?
  I can come in today.<br>
  I already told you what
 it's in reference to.<br>
  I'm trying again
 for Mrs.<br> Nayar.<br>
  Regarding the Washington
 Township scandal.<br>
  I may have found
 some information.<br>
  Please don't put
 me on hold again!
  Happy Monday, Angela.<br>
  How fun.<br>
  Thanks.<br>
 Mmm-hmm.<br>
  I'm Emily Moss' daughter
  Angela Moss.<br> I called
 Six times.<br>
  Yes.<br> I'm here to discuss the
 Washington Township case.<br>
  I'm listening.<br>
  You represented the
 victims' families.<br>
  Twenty-six families.<br>
 Mine included.<br>
  I thought, with the latest
 news in the data dumps,
  the Terry Colby scandal,
  his covering up the
 chemical waste spill
  Alleged.<br>
  Well, and documents.<br>
  Superficial.<br>
  But if we bring this
 stronger, more concrete case.<br>
  You'll see that I have the
 evidence from the data dumps,
  along with further research
  Stickies.<br> Oh, you've
 highlighted and underlined.<br>
  This is serious.<br>
  So, you wanna take Internet
 gossip to federal court
  and throw it at the
 strongest conglomerate
  in the history of civilization?
  Guy in the suit.<br>
  Twice convicted
 of sexual assault,
  charged again this past weekend.<br>
  Raped his pregnant girlfriend,
 bashed her head in with an Xbox.<br>
  Claims she cheated during Halo.<br>
  Yet I have a better
 chance of defending him.<br>
  You called back.<br>
  I called every lawyer
 from this case.<br>
  And you're the only one
 that called me back.<br>
  Shit, shit, shit
  "Connection
 closed by remote host"?
  But we had a fish.<br>
 I was in.<br>
  The exploit started
 to run and then
  Was it the code?
 Bro, what's the deal?
  I gotta take her for a walk.<br>
 Why?
  'Cause she'll piss on
 the floor if I don't.<br>
  You think I give a shit
 about your goddamn floor?
  I'm just playin', brother.<br>
 Yeah, you can take her.<br>
  You hear what I said?
  I said you can take her.<br>
  Come on.<br>
  It's out.<br>
 Okay, gotcha.<br>
  Did she like my little toy?
  Did you write that
 exploit yourself?
  I had an hour.<br>
  So, what, you just pulled code
 from Rapid9 or some shit?
  Since when did you
 become a script kiddie?
  I repeat, I had an hour.<br>
  Malware detection must've caught it.<br>
 You fucked me.<br>
  Hey, don't put this on me.<br>
  Okay, this is a shit show and you
 gave me no time to do it right.<br>
  I can run circles around an ICS given
 the proper whitepapers and time.<br>
  Where the hell are you going?
  I have no problem telling
 these two douche tools
  they're gonna have to sit on their pricks
 till we can find a better solution.<br>
  You don't understand.<br>
 These guys are
  Assholes? Yeah, I'm gonna
 tell them what's up.<br>
  That's what's up, girl.<br>
 Hmm? Now, let's go.<br>
  So, none of those guys called
 you back? Not even Lattimer?
  Pussies.<br> I bet they didn't even
 bother to read the data dumps.<br>
  But you read them.<br>
  You know it took me eight
 years to rebuild my career
  after our case was dismissed?
  So,
  as much as I think this
 company is evil incarnate,
  and trust me, they are
  You know, it's not worth it.<br>
  What would it take?
  Hypothetically,
  what do we need
 to prove our case?
  Hypothetically, a
 reliable eye witness.<br>
  You know, if you miraculously find
 someone on the inside to flip,
  someone who was there
 when the decision was made
  to falsify chemical
 waste intel
  So, unless
 you're Facebook friends
  with one of those assholes
  This hypothetical is just that.<br>
  Let's move on.<br>
  Where're you working these days?
  You have a boyfriend?
  How's your dad?
  I work for a company
 that doesn't respect me,
  my boyfriend recently
 cheated on me,
  and my father is
 drowning in debt.<br>
  I'll see you next time.<br>
 Okay.<br>
  Fluorescent lights are hell, no?
  Was there a change in schedule?
  I thought I had Spencer next.<br>
  These interviews, they're
 just a waste of your time.<br>
  I mean, you know our regulatory
 and IP issues inside out.<br>
  I was thinking we play hooky the
 rest of the day, hit the back nine.<br>
  Is that a Vacheron?
  Patek Philippe Tourbillon.<br>
  A gift from the Prince of, uh
  Oh, does it even matter?
  No.<br>
  But I'm not blowing off
 my remaining interviews.<br>
  Look,
  I know you think you
 were a shoo-in for CTO,
  and you're pissed
  Probably wishing I'd fall
 into the subway tracks.<br>
  So, how 'bout you
 cut the bullshit.<br>
  I'm afraid your paranoia
 has gotten the best of you,
  but, nevertheless,
 please excuse me.<br>
  I'll leave you to review your
 notes before Spencer arrives.<br>
  Oh, and thank you for dinner.<br>
  The entire evening
 was enchanting,
  the food, the wine
  Your lovely Sharon.<br>
  Please tell her I say hello.<br>
  Did you enjoy the view?
  What?
  Did you think she
 wouldn't tell me?
  I'm not sure what
 you're trying
  You wanna watch me piss, too?
  I've had several
 glasses of water.<br>
  Scott, a misunderstanding.<br>
  Happy to pull my dick out for
 you, if that's your thing,
  watching the Knowles
 family urinate.<br>
  Hell,
  I could fly my brother
 in from Miami.<br>
  He has a bladder
 of a small child.<br>
  You'd probably bust a nut
 watching him take a leak.<br>
  I'm not sure what she told
 you, but if I were you,
  I would tell her to find
 more appropriate ways
  of managing her imagination.<br>
  Tyrell,
  I want you to accept a hard truth,
 right here, right now, in front of me.<br>
  You are not going to be CTO.<br>
  I want to see that look
 wash over your face.<br>
  It's the only way I know
 you'll stop playing these
  silly, silly games.<br>
  Oh, I'm fully aware
 you're CTO, Scott.<br>
  I'm not sure what
 more I can offer you.<br>
  Wait.<br>
  Here.<br>
  I feel bad.<br> After all, you
 got a child on the way,
  you need all the
 help you can get.<br>
  In fact,
  this would probably pay off
 the rest of your mortgage.<br>
  Aren't you still in that neat
 little two-bedroom in Chelsea?
  There.<br>
  That's the look
 I was looking for.<br>
  I keep brute-force
 thinking, but it's not working.<br>
  I need help.<br>
  Elliot, you in there?
  Shit.<br> Why is she here?
  Elliot!
  Lemme in!
  Elliot, you in there?
  Little blonde bitty.<br>
  Elliot,
 hit the buzzer!
  I know you're in there!
  Go.<br> Shut her up and get
 her the hell outta here.<br>
  Elliot.<br> Buzzer.<br> Now.<br>
  What about Darlene?
  She stays with us.<br> And
 we'll be watching you,
  so don't bother trying any
 dumb shit, you dumb shit.<br>
  Fuck!
  Do you understand
 why you're angry?
  Because you know I'm right.<br>
  - Hey.<br>
 - Hey.<br>
  I tried looking for you after
 Gideon's the other night,
  where were you?
  I had to think about
 things, you know?
  We always knew
 what Evil Corp did.<br>
  We didn't have the proof,
  but we knew.<br>
  We were right
 about it all along.<br>
  In fact, that news report,
  it wasn't a confirmation,
  it was a reminder
  Of how angry I am.<br>
  You remember Nayar?
  The lawyer on the case.<br>
  I went to her, Elliot.<br>
  Listen, Angela, now's not a
  I have an idea that
 will change the world.<br>
  I know it sounds really stupid.<br>
  But,
  I know how to do it.<br>
  I think it could actually work.<br>
  I can't tell you
 what it is, because
  Evil Corp, Angela,
 Vera, his brother,
  Darlene, Shayla,
  - this is too much.<br> - But I feel
 passionate about it, Elliot.<br>
  I should just tell her
 what she wants to hear.<br>
  Angela,
  trust yourself.<br>
  You'll do what's right.<br>
  That's all I needed.<br>
  How's Shayla, by the way?
  She's, uh
  You know
  Tell her I say, "Hi.<br>"
  You have no time to pull off whatever
 it is you think you're doing.<br>
  What are you doing here?
 How did you know?
  Darlene.<br>
  These guys aren't playing around,
 they will fucking kill you.<br>
  Now, wise up and let's go.<br>
  Darlene's in there.<br>
 We can't leave.<br>
  Okay.<br> Then we
 call the cops.<br>
  I mean there's no
 other choice here.<br>
  It's the only way out of this.<br>
  I can't call the cops.<br>
 Shayla will die.<br>
  Oh, come on, she knew exactly what
 she was getting herself into.<br>
  You think his employees have
 a long life expectancy?
  She was dead the minute she
 started working with that maniac.<br>
  Forget it, it's not happening.<br>
  This is a zero-sum game.<br>
 Calculate all the outcomes.<br>
  If you don't pull off
 this ridiculous miracle,
  and odds are you won't,
 you die and so does Shayla.<br>
  That much we know.<br>
  But assume for a second
 that you do pull this off,
  bust Vera out of prison.<br>
  Who's to say he doesn't
 kill you, Shayla, Darlene?
  It would be in his own
 best interest to do that.<br>
  Either way, you all end up dead.<br>
  It's the only way Vera wins.<br>
  Zero-sum, Elliot.<br>
  You're playing a game
 you already lost.<br>
  You know I'm right.<br>
  No, there's gotta be a way.<br>
  I can think of a way.<br>
  I get it, kiddo.<br> You want to
 help people, watch over 'em.<br>
  Best thing you can do for Shayla,
 allow her to become a memory.<br>
  No.<br>
  True courage is about being
 honest with yourself,
  especially when it's difficult.<br>
  There's no plan where both
 you and Shayla survive.<br>
  I can think of a way.<br>
  This new world that we are so
 close to creating will never be.<br>
  And that new world, that is
 success, fsociety is success.<br>
  Look at what you accomplished
 at Steel Mountain.<br>
  That got us nowhere.<br>
  You took them down.<br>
 You won that battle.<br>
  This This is failure.<br>
  This is the old Elliot.<br>
 The one who turns to morphine,
  to drugs when he feels weak.<br>
  A coward, who can't
 face the truth,
  even though it's staring
 him right in the face.<br>
  There's
 that sensation again.<br>
  Fight-or-flight.<br>
  Three lives at stake,
 including my own.<br>
  I, Elliot Alderson, am
  What?
  Tom Petty, Pink
 Floyd, Van Halen
  What's up, man? You ain't
 got no Drake, no Pitbull,
  no nothing?
 Like, what's up?
  What the
  What's up, Rain Man?
  I'm ready to bust Vera out.<br>
  I can get into the network.<br>
  We need to go to the jail, now.<br>
  She stays here.<br>
  No, I'm not leaving you.<br>
  Don't worry, he's in no position
 to be giving out orders.<br>
  Let's go, girl.<br>
  Remember when the panic
 would set in and we had a solution?
  To be honest, I miss that.<br>
  Life is so much easier
 when you're numb.<br>
  What's the plan, bitch boy?
  First Shayla, now Darlene.<br>
  Yo, what the f Elliot,
 what are you doing?
  Like a hard drive blasted by
 excessive voltage, my mind is frayed,
  close to fried.<br>
  I can feel the static
 running through my brain.<br>
  Serotonin receptors
 working overtime.<br>
  I need more time.<br>
  Tonight, tonight, tonight.<br>
  More time, right now.<br>
  I'm working on our
 project as we speak,
  so it's in your best interest
 to keep talking with me.<br>
  At the security desk,
 my cell phone's running
  an undetectable,
 activated signal sniffer
  that will locate any kind of
 wireless signal in sight.<br>
  By the time I
 leave this building,
  I'll own its network.<br>
  Good on you.<br> Brave.<br>
  But stupid.<br>
  You showed your face,
  and then I skip out tonight
  Who do you think
 they're gonna finger?
  I'm opening every cell.<br>
  That way, they can't
 trace it back to you or me.<br>
  Yeah, bro,
  that's what I'm talking about!
  Woo!
  I told you, didn't I?
  The universe got big
 plans for us, bro.<br>
  Sit back down.<br>
  When you get out, I realize
 you're gonna have to split.<br>
  You won't be able to
 stay in the tri-state area.<br>
  Oh, I love this.<br> Go on.<br>
  Wherever you go, you're gonna
 need funding to keep surviving.<br>
  Which means, your whole operation
 still needs to be making you money.<br>
  Come on, Elliot, give it to me!
  I hacked Isaac's phone.<br>
  He had everything, your crew,
 shipments, the entire operation.<br>
  I took it all.<br> I own
 your whole world.<br>
  I need your word,
 when this goes down,
  Shayla and I go free.<br>
  You leave us alone.<br> Forever.<br>
  If anyone tries to hurt us, if I even
 see one of your guys following me,
  I leak everything.<br>
  You're saying this knowin'
  You can kill me anytime? Yes.<br>
  Yes.<br> That's why I coded the leak
 to auto-send every 24 hours
  unless I continuously
 disable it.<br>
  No one else has access.<br>
  If anything happens
 to me, or Shayla,
  your money gets deleted.<br>
  Time's up,
 Vera.<br> Let's go.<br>
  Remember,
  I'ma hug you.<br>
  So what's your deal?
  I'm here to see Terry Colby.<br>
  Who is that?
 Another damn reporter?
  No comment.<br>
 Do you understand?
  Do I know you?
  Get the hell away from my
 home, get away from my home!
  WPA2 WiFi.<br> Shit.<br>
  Borderline unhackable.<br> Getting
 that handshake could take days.<br>
  The noose is tightening.<br>
  The mobile feed on the cameras.<br>
  I don't need to hack WPA2
  when there's dedicated 4G.<br>
  We're good, I can pull this off.<br>
  Get in.<br>
 Let's go, girl.<br>
  Nah, just him.<br>
  - Yo, Isaac.<br> What you doin'?
 - Nah, bro.<br> It's, it's fine.<br>
  I just wanna have a
 private chat with him.<br>
  Come on, it's cool.<br>
  We don't have any time, man.<br>
 I gotta get to work.<br>
  Get the fuck in the car!
  Hey, man.<br> Where you goin'?
 Don't be stupid.<br>
  All good, all good.<br> We're
 just gonna have a talk.<br>
  Elliot, are you
  Why are you doing this?
 I can free your brother.<br>
  I figured it out.<br>
  It just wasn't your day, bruh.<br>
  I hacked your whole operation.<br>
 If you kill me, you
  You don't get it.<br> Like I said,
 it just wasn't your day.<br>
  Stop.<br>
  I suppose a bullet through the
 brain is peaceful in its own right.<br>
  You don't want me to free Vera.<br>
  That's why you don't care
 about the operation.<br>
  I'd pick better last words.<br>
  You're trying to kill him.<br>
  That's why Vera wants
 to leave tonight.<br>
  That's what's been
 bugging me about you.<br>
  You never wanted me
 to break him out.<br>
  Your best option for survival
 is to kill him in prison,
  because if you don't,
 you're dead.<br>
  You're the reason Vera's
 locked up right now,
  and he knows it.<br>
  Doesn't matter anyway.<br>
  Vera was just gloating about how
 he got in with the right crew,
  how he got the jump on some men.<br>
  Uh, he's not worried, man,
 he's protected now.<br>
  Bullshit.<br>
  That leaves you with
 a zero-sum game.<br>
  If you don't get him out of jail,
 he'll have you killed for failing.<br>
  Only way this works in your favor
 is for you to kill him first.<br>
  And you can't do that
 with him inside anymore.<br>
  Shut up, motherfucker.<br>
 Shut the fuck up!
  Let me free him.<br>
  When I break Vera out tonight,
  you do with your
 brother what you want.<br>
  That's the only outcome
  where you got the
 possibility of living.<br>
  It's your best move.<br>
  What makes you think I still
 won't kill you afterwards?
  I don't.<br>
  I'm just playin' my best move.<br>
  I need
 30 to 40 seconds
  with the patrol car's
 Bluetooth connection
  to run the exploit on the PLC.<br>
  And then?
  The plan
 executes at 9:49.<br>
  All the cell doors should open.<br>
  Hey.<br> I wanted to ask
 you about something.<br>
  - Oh, yeah, what's that?
 - You.<br>
  Why don't you just admit you
 think about
  Yeah, gimme a
 call, we'll grab a drink.<br>
  - Talk.<br> Whatever.<br>
 - All right.<br>
  Do you know a good spot nearby?
  The exploit's
 on his laptop.<br>
  Now I need to force feed it
 into the jail's network.<br>
  Well,
 I like what I hear.<br>
  I paused the exploit.<br> Drive.<br>
  Darlene's no longer
 part of the plan.<br>
  We got an
 alarm going on right now.<br>
  What in the hell?
  Tell you what, we go
 out, we drink, we dance,
  see where the night takes us.<br>
  You sure you wanna make
 that choice right now?
  I only need to press one
 key to run the exploit,
  or I can press another and
 disable the entire plan.<br>
  I made my move.<br>
  You make yours.<br>
  Shit.<br> Please move back, miss.<br>
  I gotta get back ASAP.<br>
  Whatever.<br>
  Look, I
 I gotta come back down now.<br>
  My computer's on the fritz.<br>
  Let's go to the meet, DJ.<br>
  If I mis-typed one
 command, hit one wrong key,
  the cell doors won't open.<br>
  And we both know
 what that means.<br>
  Did I make a mistake?
  No.<br>
  I don't make mistakes.<br>
  One minute till Vera.<br>
  For all his insane,
 inhumane ideas,
  he does understand the world,
  the wild savagery of the world.<br>
  What you need your
 piece for, bro?
  Boy Wonder says he's
 opening all the cells.<br>
  If some fool tries to rush us,
  I wanna be ready.<br>
  Hey-o, what the shit?
  Power surge.<br> Caused by all cell
 doors opening at the same time.<br>
  What, what about
 security, sirens?
  The jail's network will show
 all cells locked and closed.<br>
  Alarms are silent
 for two minutes.<br>
  Run, run, run!
  Yes! Yes.<br>
 This shit right here!
  This shit tastes better
 than any pussy I ever had!
  Whoo!
  DJ, shoot the cocksucker.<br>
  My own brother.<br>
  That's what the
 universe asked of me.<br>
  To be my brother's keeper.<br>
  Like Cain after Abel,
  I'll be a fugitive and
 wander on the earth.<br>
  A brave fugitive,
  a brave wanderer.<br>
  Look how you helped me.<br>
  That's the kind of bravery
 I been talking about.<br>
  But, but now
  Now, I want you
 to look at Isaac.<br>
  Look!
  Dead proof.<br>
  My operation is over.<br>
  So go on, crash it,
 burn it to the ground.<br>
  Doesn't matter.<br>
  I'm gone.<br>
  A spirit.<br>
  One with all the
 heavens, all existence.<br>
  Shayla!
  Where is she?
  Keys, yo.<br>
  Told you you'd get
 her back, bro.<br>
  You just didn't realize
  She was with you the whole time.<br>
  Happy New Year 2016 - New Year, New Color ;-)
